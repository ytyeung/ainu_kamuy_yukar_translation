狐が自ら歌った謡「トワトワト」

トワトワト
ある日に海辺へ食物を拾いに
出かけました.
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行きながら自分の行手を見たところが
海辺に鯨が寄り上って
人間たちがみんな盛装して
海幸をば喜び舞い海幸をば喜び躍り肉を切る者運ぶ者が
行き交かって重立った人たちは海幸をば謝し拝む者
刀をとぐ者など浜一ぱいに黒く見えます.
私はそれを見ると大層喜びました.
「ああ早くあそこへ着いて
少しでもいいから貰いたいものだ」と
思って「ばんざーい! ばんざーい」と
叫びながら
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
行って行って近くへ行って見ましたら
ちっとも思いがけなかったのに
鯨が上ったのだとばかり思ったのは
浜辺に犬どもの便所があって
大きな糞の山があります,
それを鯨だと私は思ったので
ありました.
人間たちが海幸をば喜んで躍り海幸をば喜び舞い
肉を切ったりはこんだりしているのだと
私が思ったのはからすどもが
糞をつっつき糞を散らし散らし
その方へ飛びこの方へ飛びしているのでした.
私は腹が立ちました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
海のそばから走りながら
見たところが私の行手に
舟があってその舟の中で
人間が二人互いにお悔みをのべています,
「おや,何の急変が
あるのでああいう事をしているのだろう,もしや
舟と一しょに引繰ひっくりかえった人でもあるのではないかしら,
おお早くずっと近くへ行って
人の話を聞きたいものだ.」
と思うのでフオホホーイと
高く叫んで
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして行って見たら
舟だと思ったのは浜辺にある
岩であって,人だと思ったのは
二羽の大きな鵜であったのでした.
二羽の大きな鵜が長い首をのばしたり縮めたり
しているのを悔みを言い合っている様に
私は見たのでありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらない奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして川をのぼって行きましたところが
ずーっと川上に女が二人
浅瀬に立っていて泣き合っています.
私はそれを見てビックリして
「おや,なんの悪い事があって
なんの凶報が来てあんなに泣き合って
いるのだろう?
ああ早く着いて人の話を
聞きたいものだ.」
と思って
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶ様にして行って見たら
川の中程に二つの簗やながあって
二つの簗の杭くいが流れにあたってグラグラ動いているのを
二人の女がうつむいたり仰むいたりして
泣き合っているのだと私は思ったの
でありました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
それからまた,川をのぼって
石の中ちゃらちゃら
木片の中ちゃらちゃら
飛ぶようにして帰って来ました.
自分の行手を見ましたところが
どうしたのだか
私の家が燃えあがって
大空へ立ちのぼる煙は
立ちこめた雲の様です.それを見た私は
ビックリして気を失うほど
驚きました.女の声で叫びながら
飛び上りますと,むこうから誰かが
大きな声でホーイと叫びながら私のそばへ
飛んで来ました.見るとそれは私の妻で
ビックリした顔色で息せききって,
「旦那様どうしたのですか?」
と云うので,見ると
火事の様に見えたのに
私の家はもとのまま
たっています.火もなし,煙もありません.
それは,私の妻が搗物つきものをしていると
その時に風が強く吹いて簸ている粟の
糠ぬかが吹き飛ばされるさまを
煙の様に私は見たのでありました.
食物を探しに出かけても食物も見付からず,その上に
また,私が大声を上げたので私の妻が
それに驚いて簸ていた粟をも
簸と一しょに放り飛ばしてしまったので
今夜は食べる事も出来ません
私は腹立たしくて床の底へ
身を投げて寝てしまいました.
「眼の曇ったつまらぬ奴
眼の曇った悪い奴
尻尾の下の臭い奴
尻尾の下の腐った奴
お尻からやにの出る奴
お尻から汚い水の出る奴
なんという物の見方をしたのだろう.」
  と
狐の頭かしらが物語りました.

Here's a translation of the poem, aiming for a poetic feel while maintaining the original meaning:

**The Fox's Own Ballad: "Towa Towa To"**

Towa towa to,
One day, to the shore I went,
Seeking scraps, a meal to invent.
Stone-clatter, stone-clatter,
Wood-shard, wood-shard, a scattered chatter.
Gazing ahead, my path to see,
A whale beached, a sight to me!
Humans adorned, in finery bright,
Rejoicing in bounty, with all their might.
Dancing and leaping, a sea-blessed spree,
Cutting the flesh, carrying free.
Important ones bowed, in grateful prayer,
Sharpening blades, a blackness in the air.
Seeing this feast, my heart took flight,
"Oh, to arrive there, with all my might!
A morsel, a scrap, just a taste to seize!"
"Banzai! Banzai!" I cried with ease.
Stone-clatter, stone-clatter,
Wood-shard, wood-shard, a scattered chatter.
Closer I came, with eager stride,
But what I saw, my hopes defied.
No whale beached, as I had dreamed,
But a dog's latrine, it only seemed.
A mountain of dung, upon the sand,
That I mistook, in this barren land.
The humans rejoicing, the dance and the song,
The cutting and carrying, where I didn't belong,
Were crows pecking dung, a scattered mess,
Flying this way, that way, in a feathery stress.
My anger flared, a burning brand:
"Blind fool, with vision so bland!
Blind wretch, with senses decayed!
Foul tail, where rot has played!
Tar from your rear, a sticky stain!
Filthy water, a constant drain!
What manner of sight, could lead you astray?"
Then again, I went on my way,
Stone-clatter, stone-clatter,
Wood-shard, wood-shard, a scattered chatter.
Running from the sea, my eyes did spy,
A boat afar, beneath the sky.
Two figures within, in mournful guise,
"What sudden change? What tearful cries?
Perhaps capsized, a watery grave?
Oh, to draw near, their words to save!"
"Foo-ho-hoy!" I cried aloud,
Stone-clatter, stone-clatter,
Wood-shard, wood-shard, a scattered chatter.
Flying as fast as I could go,
The boat I saw, was a rock, you know.
The figures I spied, with sorrowful mien,
Were two cormorants, a sight unseen.
Stretching their necks, then drawing them in,
Like mourners lamenting, consumed by sin.
"Blind fool, with vision so bland!
Blind wretch, with senses decayed!
Foul tail, where rot has played!
Tar from your rear, a sticky stain!
Filthy water, a constant drain!
What manner of sight, could lead you astray?"
Then again, I went on my way,
Stone-clatter, stone-clatter,
Wood-shard, wood-shard, a scattered chatter.
Flying upriver, with all my might,
Two women I saw, a sorrowful sight.
Standing in shallows, tears did stream,
"What evil has struck? What dreadful dream?
What ill-fated news, has brought them so low?
Oh, to arrive there, their grief to know!"
Stone-clatter, stone-clatter,
Wood-shard, wood-shard, a scattered chatter.
Flying as fast as I could go,
Two fish weirs I saw, in the river's flow.
The posts were shaking, in the current's sway,
And the women were weeping, in disarray.
"Blind fool, with vision so bland!
Blind wretch, with senses decayed!
Foul tail, where rot has played!
Tar from your rear, a sticky stain!
Filthy water, a constant drain!
What manner of sight, could lead you astray?"
Then again, upriver I flew,
Stone-clatter, stone-clatter,
Wood-shard, wood-shard, a scattered chatter.
Flying homeward, with weary pace,
I looked ahead, at my dwelling place.
What horror I saw, my heart did seize!
My house ablaze, carried by the breeze!
Smoke rising high, like clouds in the sky,
I gasped in shock, and nearly did die.
A woman's voice, a desperate plea,
Then someone flew near, calling to me.
My wife it was, with frightened face,
"Husband, what is it? What is this place?"
I looked again, with clearer sight,
My house stood whole, untouched by blight.
No fire, no smoke, a trick of the eye,
My wife was threshing, beneath the sky.
The wind blew strong, the chaff took flight,
And I mistook it, for a fiery sight.
I sought for food, but found only lies,
And my foolish cries, brought tears to her eyes.
She dropped the millet, in startled fright,
No supper tonight, in the fading light.
I threw myself down, in bitter despair,
And slept in anger, beyond compare.
"Blind fool, with vision so bland!
Blind wretch, with senses decayed!
Foul tail, where rot has played!
Tar from your rear, a sticky stain!
Filthy water, a constant drain!
What manner of sight, could lead you astray?"
So spoke the fox, at the end of the day.

The Fox's Self-Sung Song: "Towa Towato"

Towa towato
One day, I went to the seaside
to gather food.
Chara chara among the stones,
chara chara among the driftwood.
As I went, I looked ahead and saw
a whale washed ashore on the beach.
The people were all dressed in finery,
rejoicing and dancing for the bounty of the sea,
cutting and carrying the meat.
Important people were giving thanks and praying for the bounty of the sea,
sharpening knives, and the beach was black with them.
Seeing this, I was greatly pleased.
"Ah, I want to get there quickly
and get even a little bit!"
Thinking this, I shouted, "Banzai! Banzai!"
Chara chara among the stones,
chara chara among the driftwood.
I went and went, and when I got close,
contrary to all expectations,
what I thought was a whale washed ashore
was actually a dog toilet on the beach.
There was a huge pile of dung,
and that's what I thought was a whale.
What I thought was people rejoicing and dancing for the bounty of the sea,
cutting and carrying the meat,
was actually crows
pecking at the dung, scattering it about,
flying this way and that.
I was furious.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool!
You dim-eyed, wicked fool!
You stinky thing under the tail!
You rotten thing under the tail!
You with resin coming from your rear!
You with dirty water coming from your rear!
What kind of way of seeing things is that?!"
Then again,
chara chara among the stones,
chara chara among the driftwood.
Running from the seaside,
I looked ahead and saw
a boat, and in that boat
two people were exchanging condolences.
"Oh, what sudden change
is causing them to do such a thing? Perhaps
someone has capsized with the boat?
Oh, I want to go closer quickly
and hear what people are saying!"
Thinking this, I shouted loudly, "Foo hoo hooi!"
Chara chara among the stones,
chara chara among the driftwood.
I flew like the wind to see, but
what I thought was a boat was a
rock on the beach, and what I thought were people
were two large cormorants.
I saw the two large cormorants stretching and shrinking their long necks
as if they were exchanging condolences.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool!
You dim-eyed, wicked fool!
You stinky thing under the tail!
You rotten thing under the tail!
You with resin coming from your rear!
You with dirty water coming from your rear!
What kind of way of seeing things is that?!"
Then again,
chara chara among the stones,
chara chara among the driftwood.
I flew like the wind and went up the river, and
far upstream, there were two women
standing in the shallows, weeping together.
Seeing this, I was startled.
"Oh, what bad thing has happened?
What ill tidings have come that they are weeping so?
Oh, I want to get there quickly
and hear what people are saying!"
Thinking this,
chara chara among the stones,
chara chara among the driftwood.
I flew like the wind to see, but
in the middle of the river, there were two fish weirs,
and I thought that the two women were weeping together, looking up and down,
because the stakes of the two weirs were moving and shaking in the current.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool!
You dim-eyed, wicked fool!
You stinky thing under the tail!
You rotten thing under the tail!
You with resin coming from your rear!
You with dirty water coming from your rear!
What kind of way of seeing things is that?!"
Then again, I went up the river,
chara chara among the stones,
chara chara among the driftwood.
I flew like the wind and came back.
I looked ahead and saw that
for some reason,
my house was burning up,
and the smoke rising into the sky
was like a gathering cloud. Seeing this, I
was so startled that I almost lost consciousness.
I jumped up, shouting in a woman's voice, and
someone came flying toward me from the other side,
shouting loudly, "Hooi!" When I looked, it was my wife,
with a startled look on her face, breathless.
"Husband, what's wrong?"
she said. When I looked,
what had looked like a fire
was that my house was standing as it was.
There was no fire, no smoke.
It was that my wife was hulling grain, and
at that time, the wind was blowing strongly, and
I had seen the way the blown-away rice bran
looked like smoke.
Even though I went out to look for food, I couldn't find any, and on top of that,
because I shouted so loudly, my wife
was so startled that she threw away the grain she was hulling
along with the hull, so
we can't eat tonight.
I was furious and threw myself onto the floor
and went to sleep.
"You dim-eyed, worthless fool!
You dim-eyed, wicked fool!
You stinky thing under the tail!
You rotten thing under the tail!
You with resin coming from your rear!
You with dirty water coming from your rear!
What kind of way of seeing things is that?!"
So
the fox's head told the story.
