兎が自ら歌った謡「サンパヤ テレケ」

サンパヤ テレケ
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら兄様のあとをしたって山へ行きました.
毎日毎日兄様のあとへ行って見ると
人間が弩いしゆみを仕掛けて置いてあるとその弩を兄様が
こわしてしまう,それを私は笑うのを
常としていたのでこの日また
行って見たら,ちっとも
思いがけない
兄様が弩にかかって泣き叫んでいる.
私はビックリして,兄様のそばへ
飛んで行ったら兄様は
泣きながら云うことには,
「これ弟よ,今これから
お前は走って行って
私たちの村の後へ着いたら
兄様が弩にかかったよ――,フオホホーイと
大声でよぶのだよ.」
私はきいて
ハイ,ハイ,と返辞をして,それから
二つの谷,三つの谷を飛び越え飛び越え
遊びながら来て
私たちの村の村後へ着きました.
そこではじめて兄様が私を使いによこしたことを
思い出しました,私は大声で叫び声を挙げようとした
が,兄様が何を言って私を使によこしてあったのか
すっかり私は忘れていました.そこに立ちつくして
思い出そうとしたがどうしてもだめだ.
それからまた
二つの谷を越え三つの谷を越え
後へ逆飛び逆躍びしながら
兄様のいる所へ来て
見ると誰もいない.
兄様の血だけがそこらに附いていた.
(ここまでで話は外へ飛ぶ)
ケトカ ウォイウォイ ケトカ,ケトカ ウォイ ケトカ
毎日毎日私は山へ行って
人間が弩を仕掛けてあるのをこわして
それを面白がるのが常であった所が
ある日また,前の所に弩が仕掛けて
あると,その側に小さい蓬よもぎの弩が
仕掛けてある,
私はそれを見ると
「こんな物,何にする物だろう.」
と思っておかしいので
ちょとそれに触って見た,直ぐに逃げようと
したら,思いがけ
なく,その弩にいやという程
はまってしまった.
逃げようともがけば
もがくほど,強くしめられるのでどうする事も
出来ないので,私は泣いて
いると,私の側へ何だか
飛んで来たので見るとそれは私の弟
であった.私はよろこんで,私たちの一族のものに
この事を知らせる様に言いつけてやったが
それからいくら待っても何の音もない.
私は泣いていると,私の側へ
人の影があらわれた.見ると,
神の様な美しい人間の若者
ニコニコして,私を取って,
どこかへ持って行った.見ると
大きな家の中が神の宝物で
一ぱいになっている.
彼かの若者は火を焚いて,
大きな鍋を火にかけて,掛けてある刀を引き抜いて
私のからだを皮のままブツブツに切って
鍋一ぱいに入れそれから鍋の下へ頭を突き入れ突き入れ
火を焚きつけ出した.どうかして
逃げたいので私は人間の若者の隙を
ねらうけれども,人間の若者はちっとも私から
眼をはなさない.
「鍋が煮え立って私が煮えてしまったら,なんにも
ならないつまらない死方,悪い死方をしなければならない.」と
思って人間の若者の油断を
ねらってねらって,やっとの事
一片の肉に自分を化かわらして
立ち上る湯気に身を交まじえて鍋の椽に
上り,左の座へ飛び下りると直ぐに
戸外へ飛び出した,泣きながら
飛んで息を切らして逃げて来て
私の家へ着いて
ほんとうにあぶないことであったと胸撫で下した.
後ふりかえって見ると,
ただの人間,ただの若者とばかり
思っていたのはオキキリムイ,神の様な強い方
なのでありました.
ただの人間が仕掛けた弩だと思って
毎日毎日悪戯をしたのをオキキリムイ
は大そう怒って蓬の小弩で
私を殺そうとしたのだが,私も
ただの身分の軽い神でもないのに,つまらない死方,悪い死方
をしたら,私の親類のもの共も,困り惑うであろう
事を不憫に思って下されて
おかげで,私が逃げても追いかけなかった
のでありました.
それから,前には,兎は
鹿ほども体の大きなものであったが,
この様な悪戯を私がしたために
オキキリムイの一つの肉片ほど小さくなったのです.
これからの私たちの仲間はみんなこの位の
からだになるのであろう.
これからの兎たちよ,決していたずらをしなさるな.
と,兎の首領が子供等を教えて死にました.

Here's a translation of the poem, aiming for a balance of accuracy and poetic feel:

**The Hare's Own Song: "Sanpaya Tereke"**

Sanpaya Tereke,
Across two valleys, three valleys leaping,
I followed my brother, playful, to the mountain's keep.
Each day I trailed him, to where he found
A human's crossbow, laid upon the ground.
My brother broke the bow, with mighty paw,
And I would laugh, at what I saw.
This day, as always, I went to play,
But found a sight that stole my breath away.

My brother caught, ensnared within the snare,
He cried in pain, a sound I couldn't bear.
I rushed to him, with heart in frantic flight,
He spoke through tears, bathed in fading light:
"Dear brother, run! Go swiftly to our home,
And shout behind the village, 'Brother's caught, alone!'
Cry 'Foo-ho-hoy!' Let all the valley hear!"
I bowed my head, "Yes, brother, have no fear!"

Across two valleys, three valleys leaping,
I ran, though playful thoughts kept creeping.
I reached our village, at the rear I stood,
Then realized the task for which I should
Have shouted loud, the message I must bring,
But all the words had vanished on the wing.
I stood there, blank, my memory a haze,
Lost in the sunlit, bewildering maze.

Then back again, across the valleys wide,
I leaped and bounded, with the turning tide.
I found the place where he had been before,
But now, alas, my brother was no more.
Only his blood remained, a crimson stain...
(Here the tale takes flight, to a different plane.)

Ketoka, woi-woi, ketoka, ketoka, woi, ketoka,
Each day I went, to where the humans set
Their cruel crossbows, a game I couldn't forget.
One day I found, beside the larger snare,
A tiny crossbow, made of mugwort rare.

I looked at it, "What use could this thing be?"
And touched it, curious, foolishly.
I tried to flee, but then, to my dismay,
The little bow had trapped me in its way.
The more I struggled, the more it held me tight,
I wept in fear, consumed by endless night.

Then something flew to me, a welcome sight,
My brother came, to ease my dreadful plight.
I bid him tell our kin of my despair,
But silence followed, hanging in the air.
I wept again, when suddenly I spied
A human form, approaching to my side.
A youth of beauty, like a god so fair,
He smiled and took me, to a place beyond compare.

A house of wonders, filled with treasures bright,
A god's own hoard, bathed in ethereal light.
He lit a fire, beneath a cauldron vast,
Drew forth a blade, its shadow grimly cast.
He cut my flesh, in pieces small and grim,
And filled the pot, right to the very brim.
Then plunged my head, beneath the bubbling brew,
And stoked the flames, with purpose strong and true.

I knew I must escape, or meet a dreadful end,
A pointless death, from which there's no ascend.
I watched the youth, for any moment's lapse,
And changed myself, into a tiny scrap.
A wisp of vapor, rising from the pot,
I floated upward, to a safer spot.
I leaped to freedom, to the left I flew,
And fled in terror, from that awful view.
I reached my home, my breath a ragged plea,
And sighed in relief, "How close I came to be..."

I looked behind, and saw the truth at last,
The human youth, whose shadow had been cast,
Was not a mortal, but Okikirmui,
A god of power, watching over me.
He saw my pranks, the crossbows I destroyed,
And in his anger, sought to fill the void
With mugwort's magic, to end my foolish game.
But I, though small, possessed a sacred name.
To die so meanly, would bring shame and pain,
To all my kin, a sorrow-laden stain.
He spared my life, and let me run away,
And did not chase me, on that fateful day.

From that day forth, the hare, once large and bold,
As big as deer, a story to be told,
Was shrunk and humbled, by Okikirmui's hand,
A tiny creature, in this sacred land.
Our kin will all be small, from this day on,
So heed my words, and let your pranks be gone!"
The elder hare, his lesson taught with care,
Then closed his eyes, and breathed his final prayer.

Here's the English translation of the Japanese text, aiming to preserve the original meaning and tone:

**The Song the Rabbit Sang Himself: "Sanpaya Tereke"**

Sanpaya Tereke
Leaping over two valleys, leaping over three valleys,
While playing, I followed my elder brother to the mountain.
Every day, going after my elder brother, I saw
That a human had set up a crossbow trap, and my elder brother
Would break it. I always laughed at this.
So, on this day, when I went again,
Unexpectedly,
My elder brother was caught in the crossbow, crying out.
I was startled and flew to my elder brother's side.
Crying, my elder brother said,
"Listen, little brother, now, from here,
You must run and go behind our village.
Then shout loudly, 'Elder brother is caught in the crossbow! – Hoo-ho-ho-i!'"
I listened and replied,
"Yes, yes," and then,
Leaping over two valleys, leaping over three valleys,
While playing, I came to
The back of our village.
There, I finally remembered that my elder brother had sent me on an errand.
I tried to raise a loud cry,
But I completely forgot what my elder brother had told me to say.
I stood there, trying to remember, but it was no use.
Then again,
Crossing two valleys, crossing three valleys,
Leaping backwards, jumping backwards,
I came to the place where my elder brother was.
But no one was there.
Only my elder brother's blood was splattered around.
(Here the story jumps to another part)
Ketoka, woi-woi, ketoka, ketoka, woi, ketoka.
Every day, I went to the mountain
And broke the crossbows that humans had set up,
Always enjoying it.
Then one day, at the usual place, a crossbow was set up.
Next to it, a small mugwort crossbow was set up.
When I saw it,
I thought, "What is this thing for?"
And because it seemed funny,
I touched it a little. I tried to run away immediately,
But unexpectedly,
I was caught in that crossbow, more than I wanted to be.
The more I struggled to escape,
The tighter it squeezed, so I couldn't do anything.
I was crying,
When something flew to my side.
When I looked, it was my younger brother.
I was happy and told him to inform our clan of this.
But no sound came, no matter how long I waited.
I was crying, when
A human shadow appeared beside me. When I looked,
It was a young human, beautiful like a god.
Smiling, he took me
And carried me somewhere. When I looked,
The inside of a large house was filled with divine treasures.
That young man lit a fire,
Put a large pot over the fire, drew a hanging sword,
Cut my body, skin and all, into small pieces,
Filled the pot, and then stuck his head under the pot,
And started stoking the fire.
Wanting to escape somehow, I watched for an opening in the human's attention.
But the human never took his eyes off me.
"If the pot boils and I get cooked, it will be
A meaningless death, a bad death," I thought.
Watching for the human's carelessness,
Watching and watching, I finally
Transformed myself into a piece of meat,
Mixed myself with the rising steam, climbed onto the edge of the pot,
Jumped down to the left side, and immediately
Leapt outside. Crying,
I flew, panting, and escaped to
My home.
I was truly in danger, I sighed in relief.
Looking back,
The one I thought was just a human, just a young man,
Was Okikirmui, a strong one like a god.
Okikirmui was very angry that I had played pranks
On the crossbows set up by ordinary humans every day,
And tried to kill me with the small mugwort crossbow.
But I, too, am not just a god of low status. If I had a meaningless death, a bad death,
My relatives would be troubled and confused.
He took pity on me,
And thanks to that, he didn't chase me when I escaped.
Before this, rabbits
Were as big as deer.
But because I did such a prank,
I became as small as one of Okikirmui's meat pieces.
From now on, all of our companions will probably be this size.
Rabbits from now on, never play pranks.
And so, the rabbit chief taught his children and died.
