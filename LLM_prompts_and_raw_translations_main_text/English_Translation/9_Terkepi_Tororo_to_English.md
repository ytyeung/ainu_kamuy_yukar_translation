蛙が自らを歌った謡
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」

トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!
「ある日に,草原を飛び廻って
遊んでいるうちに見ると,
一軒の家があるので戸口へ行って
見ると,家の内に宝の積んである側に
高床がある.その高床の上に
一人の若者が鞘を刻んでうつむいて
いたので,私は悪戯をしかけようと思って敷居の上に
坐って,「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴いた,ところが,彼の若者は刀持つ手を上げ
私を見ると,ニッコリ笑って,
「それはお前の謡かえ? お前の喜びの歌かえ?
もっと聞きたいね.」というので
私はよろこんで「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と
鳴くと,彼の若者のいう事には,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」
私はそれをきいて嬉しく思い下座の方の
炉縁の上へピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴くと
彼の若者のいうことには,
「それはお前のユーカラかえ? サケハウかえ?
もっと近くで聞きたいね.」それを聞くと私は,
本当に嬉しくなって,上座の方の炉縁の
隅のところへピョンと飛んで
「トーロロ ハンロク ハンロク!」と鳴いたら
突然!彼の若者がパッと起ち
上ったかと思うと,大きな薪の燃えさしを
取り上げて私の上へ投げつけた音は
体の前がふさがったように思われて,それっきり
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気がついて見たら
芥捨あくすて場の末に,一つの腹のふくれた蛙が
死んでいて,その耳と耳との間に私はすわっていた.
よく見ると,ただの人間の家
だと思ったのは,オキキリムイ,神の様に
強い方の家なのであった,そして
オキキリムイだという事も知らずに
私が悪戯をしたのであった.
私はもう今この様につまらない死方,悪い死方
をするのだから,これからの
蛙たちよ,決して,人間たちに悪戯をするのではないよ.
と,ふくれた蛙が云いながら死んでしまった.

**The Frog's Self-Sung Song**
*"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"*

Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!
"One day, as I hopped and played
Across the meadow's sunlit sway,
A house I spied, and drew anear,
To find its threshold, banish fear.
Inside, a treasure did reside,
Beside a platform, built with pride.
Upon it sat a youth so fair,
A scabbard carving, lost in care.
A prank I planned, a playful jest,
Upon the sill, I took my rest,
And sang, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"
The youth looked up, his gaze on me,
A smile he gave, for all to see.
"Is that your song? Your joyful sound?
More would I hear, on hallowed ground."
Delighted then, I sang anew,
"Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"
The youth replied, his voice so clear,
"Your Yukar, perhaps? A sacred cheer?
I'd hear it closer, if you please."
My heart with joy found perfect ease,
I hopped down then, with nimble grace,
To hearthside's edge, a lower place,
And sang, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"
The youth then spoke, his words so true,
"Your Yukar, perhaps? A sacred view?
I'd hear it closer, come draw nigh."
My joy soared up into the sky,
I leaped again, with all my might,
To hearthside's corner, bathed in light,
And sang, "Toh-ro-ro Han-ro-ku Han-ro-ku!"
Then swift! The youth arose in haste,
A burning brand, he did embrace,
And flung it down with mighty hand,
A darkness fell across the land.
My world went black, I knew no more,
What fate had held within its store.

I woke to find, in garbage heap,
A bloated frog, in slumber deep,
And 'twixt his ears, I sat forlorn,
A sorry sight, a life outworn.
I saw at last, with dawning dread,
No human home, but sacred stead,
Of Okikirmui, strong and grand,
A god's abode, in this fair land.
And knowing not, in foolish play,
I'd courted fate, and lost the day.
Now I must die, a wretched end,
A warning to all froggy friend:
Never tease humans, understand!
The bloated frog, breathed his last command."

The Frog's Song About Itself

"Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"

Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!
"One day, while hopping around the meadow and playing,
I saw a house, so I went to the doorway.
Inside, on the side where treasures were piled,
there was a raised platform. On that platform,
a young man was carving a scabbard, looking down.
I thought I would play a prank, so I sat on the threshold
and croaked, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
Then, the young man raised the hand holding his knife,
looked at me, and smiled sweetly,
"Is that your song? Is that your song of joy?
I want to hear more." So,
I happily croaked, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
Then, the young man said,
"Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau?
I want to hear it closer."
Hearing that, I was delighted and hopped down to the lower seat,
onto the edge of the hearth,
and croaked, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
Then, the young man said,
"Is that your Yukar? Your Sakehau?
I want to hear it closer." Hearing that, I was
truly happy, and hopped to the corner of the hearth
on the upper seat,
and croaked, "Tororo Hanroku Hanroku!"
Suddenly! The young man jumped up
and, as if ascending, grabbed a large burning log
and threw it at me. The sound was like
my front being blocked off, and after that,
I don't know what happened.
When I came to,
at the end of the garbage dump, there was a frog with a swollen belly
lying dead, and I was sitting between its ears.
Looking closely, what I thought was just a human house
was actually the house of Okikirmui, a god-like
powerful being. And,
without knowing it was Okikirmui,
I had played a prank.
Now, I am going to die such a trivial death, such a bad death,
so from now on,
frogs, never play pranks on humans."
And with that, the swollen frog died.
