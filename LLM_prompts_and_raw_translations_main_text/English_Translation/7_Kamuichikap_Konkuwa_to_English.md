梟の神が自ら歌った謡
         「コンクワ」

「コンクワ
昔私の物言う時は桜皮を巻いた弓の
弓把きゅうはの央を鳴り渡らす如くに
言ったのであったが,
今は衰え年老いてしまった事よ.
けれども誰か雄弁で
使者としての自信を持ってる者があったら,
天国へ五ツ半の談判
を言いつけてやりたいものだ.」と
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
私は言った,ところが入口で誰かが
「私をおいて誰が使者として雄弁で
自信のあるものがあるでしょう.」というので
見ると鴉からすの若者であった.
私は家に入れて,それから,たがつきのシントコの
蓋の上をたたきながら
鴉の若者を使者にたてる為
その談判を云いきかせて三日たって
三つ目の談判を話しながら見ると
鴉の若者は炉縁の後で
居眠りをしている,それを見ると,癪しゃくに
さわったので鴉の若者を
羽ぐるみ引っぱたいて殺してしまった.
それから又たがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら
「誰か使者として自信のある者が
あれば天国へ五ツ半の
談判を言いつけてやりたい.」と
言うと,誰かがまた入口へ
「誰が私をおいて,雄弁で
天国へ使者に立つほどの者がありましょう.」
と言うので見ると山のかけす
であった.
家へ入れてそれからまた
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の談判を話して
四日たって,四つの用向を言っているうちに
山のかけすは炉縁の後で居眠りをしている.
私は腹が立って山のかけすを羽ぐるみひっぱたいて
殺してしまった.
それからまたたがつきのシントコの蓋の上を
たたきながら,
「誰か雄弁で使者として
自信のある者があれば,天国へ
五ツ半の談判を持たせてやりたい.」
と言うと,誰かが
慎つつしみ深い態度ではいって来たので見ると
川ガラスの若者,美しい様子で
左の座に坐った.それで私は
たがつきのシントコの蓋の上をたたきながら
五ツ半の用件を夜でも
昼でも言い続けた.見れば
川ガラスの若者,何も疲れた様子もなく
聞いていて昼と夜を
数えて六日目に
私が言い終ると直ぐに天窗から
出て天国へ行ってしまった.
その談判の大むねは,人間の世界に
饑饉があって人間たちは今にも
餓死しようとしている.どういう訳かと
見ると天国に
鹿を司つかさどる神様と魚を司る神様とが
相談をして鹿も出さず魚も出さぬことに
したからであったので,神様たちから
どんなに言われても知らぬ顔をして
いるので人間たちは猟に
山へ行っても鹿も無い,魚漁に
川へ行っても魚も無い.
私はそれを見て腹が立ったので
鹿の神,魚の神へ使者をたてた
のである.
それから幾日もたって
空の方に微かな音がきこえていたが
誰かがはいって来た.見ると
川ガラスの若者,今は前よりも美しさを増し
勇ましい気品をそなえて
返し談判を述べはじめた.
天国の鹿の神や魚の神が
今日まで鹿を出さず魚を出さなかった
理由は,人間たちが鹿を捕る時に
木で鹿の頭をたたき,皮を剥ぐと
鹿の頭をそのまま山の木原に
捨ておき,魚をとると
腐れ木で魚の頭をたたいて殺すので,
鹿どもは,裸で泣きながら
鹿の神の許もとへ帰り,魚どもは
腐れ木をくわえて魚の神の
許へ帰る.鹿の神,魚の神は
怒って相談をし,鹿を出さず
魚を出さなかったのであった.がこののち
人間たちが鹿でも魚でも
ていねいに取扱うという事なら鹿も出す
魚も出すであろう,と鹿の神と
魚の神が言ったという事を詳しく申し立てた.
私はそれを聞いてから川ガラスの若者に
讃辞を呈して,見ると本当に
人間たちは鹿や魚を
粗末に取扱ったのであった.
それから,以後は,決してそんな事をしない様に
人間たちに,眠りの時,夢の中に
教えてやったら,人間たちも
悪かったという事に気が付き,それからは
幣ぬさの様に魚をとる道具を美しく作り
それで魚をとる.鹿をとったときは,鹿の頭も
きれいに飾って祭る,それで
魚たちは,よろこんで美しい御幣ごへいをくわえて
魚の神のもとに行き,鹿たちは
よろこんで新しく月代さかやきをして鹿の神
のもとに立ち帰る.それを鹿の神や
魚の神はよろこんで
沢山,魚を出し,沢山,鹿を出した.
人間たちは,今はもうなんの困る事も
ひもじい事もなく暮している,
私はそれを見て安心をした.
私は,もう年老い,衰え弱った
ので,天国へ行こうと
思っていたのだけれども,私が守護している人間の国に
饑饉があって人間たちが餓死しようとしているのに
構わずに行く事が出来ないので,
これまで居たのだけれども,今はもう
なんの気がかりも無いから,最も強い者
若い勇者を私のあとにおき人間の世を
守護させて,今天国へ行く所なのだ.
と,国の守護神なる翁神(梟)が
物語って天国へ行きました.と.

Here's a poetic translation of the Japanese poem, aiming to capture the original meaning and tone:

**The Owl God's Own Song: "Konkwa"**

"Konkwa...
In days of old, my voice, when I did speak,
Resounded like the twang of a cherry-bark bound bow,
Its center singing, clear and strong.
But now, alas, I'm frail, and age has taken hold.
Yet, if there be one, eloquent and bold,
With confidence to serve as envoy true,
I'd send him forth to Heaven's gate,
To plead a case of five and a half."

So I declared, upon the lacquered Shintoko's lid,
When at the entrance, a voice did bid,
"Who else but I, with silver tongue so bright,
Possesses such assurance, such unwavering light?"
I looked, and saw a raven, young and keen.
I welcomed him within, then once again,
Upon the Shintoko's lid, I tapped and told
The raven youth the tale to be unrolled.
Three days I spoke, the plea I did impart,
But on the third, I saw, with heavy heart,
The raven slumbering by the hearth's warm glow.
My anger flared, and with a furious blow,
I struck him down, his feathers stained with red.

Then once more, upon the Shintoko's head,
I tapped and cried, "Is there one brave and free,
With confidence to plead in Heaven for me?"
And at the door, a voice again did call,
"Who else but I, could answer to your call,
To stand before the gods, and make our plea?"
A jay it was, from mountains wild and free.
I brought him in, and then, as before,
Upon the Shintoko's lid, I did implore,
The tale of five and a half, I did unfold.
Four days I spoke, the reasons to be told,
But as I spoke, I saw, with rising ire,
The jay asleep, beside the dying fire.
I struck him down, his feathers scattered wide.

Then once more, upon the Shintoko's side,
I tapped and cried, "Is there one bold and bright,
To carry forth our plea to Heaven's light?"
Then someone came, with humble, gentle grace,
A river crow, with beauty in his face,
He sat to my left, with quiet dignity.
And I, upon the Shintoko, endlessly,
By night and day, the five and a half did tell.
The river crow, he listened, calm and well,
No sign of weariness upon his brow.
Six days he heard, and when I finished, how
He soared through the skylight, swift and true,
To carry forth our plea to Heaven's view.

The plea was this: a famine grips the land,
The people starve, upon the barren sand.
For in the Heavens, the deer god and the fish,
Conspired to grant no creature to our wish.
They turned a deaf ear to our mortal cries,
So hunters find no deer beneath the skies,
And fishermen cast nets in empty streams.
This angered me, and fueled my desperate dreams,
To send an envoy to the gods above.

Then days went by, a whisper from above,
And someone came, the river crow returned,
With greater beauty, and a spirit burned
With noble purpose, he began to speak,
The gods' reply, both bitter and unique.
"The deer and fish, they have withheld their grace,
Because of how you treat the hunted race.
You strike the deer with wood, upon the head,
And leave their skulls upon the mountain bed.
You kill the fish with rotten wood and scorn,
The deer return to me, naked and forlorn,
The fish, with splinters, seek my healing hand.
So we conspired, to punish all the land.
But if you promise, from this very day,
To treat the creatures with respect, they say,
Then deer and fish, we shall release once more."

I praised the crow, and pondered what was lore.
Indeed, the people treated beasts with shame.
I taught them then, in dreams, to mend their name.
They saw their error, and with hearts renewed,
They crafted tools with beauty, understood
The need for reverence. They adorned the head
Of every deer, and honored all the dead.
The fish, with joy, took offerings to the sea,
The deer, renewed, returned in ecstasy.
The gods rejoiced, and blessed us from above,
With fish and deer, and overflowing love.
The people prospered, hunger was no more,
And peace and plenty flourished on our shore.

I am old and weak, my time is near,
I thought to journey to the heavens clear,
But could not leave my people in despair.
Now that they thrive, and know a life to share,
I pass my duty to a younger hand,
A hero strong, to watch upon the land.
And now, I go to Heaven's gate above."

So spoke the Owl God, guardian of our love,
And vanished to the heavens, far away.

The Owl God's Own Song: "Konkwa"

"Konkwa,
In the past, when I spoke, it was like the twang of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark,
Resonating from the center of the bow's grip.
But now, I am weakened and old.
However, if there is someone eloquent and
Confident as a messenger,
I would like to entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half points with Heaven."

So I said, tapping on the lid of a hooped Shintoko container. Then, someone at the entrance said,
"Who else but me is eloquent and
Confident enough to be a messenger?"
When I looked, it was a young crow.
I let him into the house, and then, tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko container,
I explained the negotiation to the young crow, intending to make him my messenger. After three days,
As I was explaining the third point of the negotiation, I saw
The young crow dozing off behind the hearth. Seeing this, I became irritated and
Slapped the young crow with his feathers and killed him.
Then again, tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko container,
"If there is anyone confident enough to be a messenger,
I would like to entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half points with Heaven," I said.
Then, someone again at the entrance said,
"Who else but me is eloquent and
Worthy enough to be a messenger to Heaven?"
When I looked, it was a mountain jay.
I let him into the house, and then again,
Tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko container,
I explained the negotiation of five and a half points.
After four days, as I was explaining the fourth point,
The mountain jay was dozing off behind the hearth.
I became angry and slapped the mountain jay with his feathers and killed him.
Then again, tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko container,
"If there is anyone eloquent and confident as a messenger,
I would like to entrust them with a negotiation of five and a half points with Heaven,"
I said. Then, someone
Entered with a respectful attitude. When I looked, it was
A young river crow, beautiful in appearance,
Who sat on the left side. So I,
Tapping on the lid of the hooped Shintoko container,
Continued to explain the five and a half points day and
Night. When I looked,
The young river crow showed no signs of fatigue and listened.
On the sixth day of counting day and night,
As soon as I finished speaking, he went out through the skylight
And went to Heaven.
The gist of the negotiation was that there was
A famine in the human world, and the humans were on the verge of
Starving to death. When I investigated the reason, it was because
The god who governs deer and the god who governs fish in Heaven
Had consulted and decided not to send out deer or fish.
No matter how much they were told by the gods, they pretended not to know,
So even when humans went to the mountains to hunt, there were no deer, and even when they went to the rivers to fish, there were no fish.
I was angered by this, so
I sent a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.

After many days had passed,
A faint sound could be heard in the sky.
Then someone entered. When I looked, it was
The young river crow, now even more beautiful than before,
Endowed with a brave dignity,
Who began to state the counter-negotiation.
The reason why the deer god and the fish god of Heaven
Had not sent out deer or fish until today
Was because when humans caught deer, they
Hit the deer's head with wood, and when they skinned it, they
Left the deer's head as it was in the mountain forest.
And when they caught fish, they
Killed them by hitting their heads with rotten wood.
So the deer, naked and crying,
Returned to the deer god's presence, and the fish,
Holding rotten wood in their mouths,
Returned to the fish god's presence. The deer god and the fish god were
Angry and consulted, and did not send out deer
Or fish. But if from now on
Humans treat deer and fish
Carefully, then they will send out deer
And fish, the deer god and
The fish god said, he stated in detail.
After hearing that, I presented
Praises to the young river crow. When I looked, it was true that
Humans had treated deer and fish
Carelessly.
From then on, I taught
The humans in their dreams while they slept
Not to do such things again. The humans also
Realized that they had been wrong, and from then on, they
Made fishing tools beautifully, like *nusa* offerings,
And used them to catch fish. When they caught deer, they also
Decorated the deer's head beautifully and worshipped it. So
The fish rejoiced and held beautiful *gohei* offerings in their mouths
And went to the fish god's presence, and the deer
Rejoiced and had their forelocks freshly shaved and returned
To the deer god's presence. The deer god and
The fish god were pleased and
Sent out many fish and many deer.
The humans now live without any hardship or
Hunger.
I was relieved to see that.
I am now old and weakened,
So I was thinking of going to Heaven,
But because there was a famine in the human country that I protect, and the humans were on the verge of starving to death,
I could not go without caring,
So I have stayed until now. But now there is no
Cause for concern, so I will place the strongest,
Youngest hero in my place to protect the human world,
And now I am going to Heaven."
So, the old god (owl), the guardian deity of the country,
Narrated and went to Heaven.
