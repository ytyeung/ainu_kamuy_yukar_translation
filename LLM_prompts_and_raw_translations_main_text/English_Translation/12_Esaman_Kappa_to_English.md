獺かわうそが自ら歌った謡
「カッパ レウレウ カッパ」

カッパ レウレウ カッパ
ある日に,流れに沿うて遊びながら
泳いで下りサマユンクルの
水汲路のところに来ると,
サマユンクルの妹が神の様な美しい容子で
片手に手桶を持ち片手に
蒲の束を持って来ているので
川の縁に私は頭だけ出し,
「お父様をお持ちですか?
お母様をお持ちですか?」と云うと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見つけると,怒の色を顔に
現して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと,大きな犬どもが
駈け出して来て,私を見ると牙を鳴ら
している.私はビックリして川の底へ
潜り込んで直ぐそのまま川底を通って
逃げ下った.
そうして,オキキリムイの水汲路の
川口へ頭だけだして
見ると,オキキリムイの妹が
神の様に美しい様子で片手に手桶を持ち
片手に蒲の束を持って
来たので私のいうことには,
「御父様をお持ちですか?
御母様をお持ちですか?」というと,
娘さんは驚いて眼をきょろきょろさせ
私を見ると,怒りの色を顔に
表して,
「まあ,にくらしい扁平頭,悪い扁平頭が
人をばかにして.犬たちよ,ココ......」
と言うと大きな犬どもが駈け出して来た.
それを見て私は先刻の事を思い出し
可笑しく思いながら川の底へ
潜りこんで逃げようとしたら,
まさか犬たちがそんな事をしようとは
思わなかったのに,牙を鳴らしながら
川の底まで私に飛び付き
陸へ私を引き摺り上げ,私の頭も私の体も
噛みつかれ噛みむしられて,しまいに
どうなったかわからなくなってしまった.
ふと気が付いて見ると,
大きな獺の耳と耳の間に私はすわって
いた.
サマユンクルもオキキリムイも
父もなく母もないのを私は知って
あんな悪戯をしたので罰を当てられ
オキキリムイの犬どもに殺され
つまらない死方,悪い死方をするのです.
これからの獺たちよ,決して悪戯をしなさるな.
と,獺が物語った.

Here's a translation of the poem, aiming for a balance of accuracy and poetic feel:

**The Otter's Own Lament**

"Kappa Reu Reu Kappa," I sang,

Kappa Reu Reu Kappa.
One day, drifting with the stream's gentle hand,
I swam down to Samayunkuru's land,
Where maidens drew water, a sacred rite.
Samayunkuru's sister, a vision of light,
With pail in one hand, reeds in the other,
Came to the river, like no other.
I peeked from the water, just my head in view,
"Do you have a father? A mother, too?"

The maiden startled, her eyes did roam,
Then found me there, and her face turned home
To anger's hue. "You hateful flat-head,
You wicked flat-head, mocking instead!
Dogs, seize him now! Here, Coco, here!"
Great hounds then charged, their teeth so near.
I panicked, diving deep, a watery flight,
And fled downstream, swallowed by the night.

Then, at Okikirimui's watering place,
I surfaced again, with hopeful grace.
Okikirimui's sister, a goddess fair,
With pail and reeds, beyond compare,
Appeared as before. I spoke once more,
"Do you have a father? A mother to adore?"

The maiden startled, her eyes did dart,
Then found me there, and anger's dart
Flashed on her face. "You hateful flat-head,
You wicked flat-head, mocking instead!
Dogs, seize him now! Here, Coco, here!"
Great hounds then charged, fueled by their fear.

Remembering the past, a foolish grin,
I dove to escape, to the depths within.
But the dogs, alas, had a different plan,
They leaped in the water, a furious clan.
They dragged me ashore, with teeth so keen,
My head, my body, a mangled scene.
I lost all sense, my fate unknown,
Until I awoke, utterly alone.

Between the ears of a great otter, I sat,
A prisoner now, where once I was at.
Samayunkuru and Okikirimui,
Had neither father nor mother, I knew.
My pranks were the cause, my fate was sealed,
By Okikirimui's dogs, my life revealed
A foolish death, a wretched end.
So heed my words, otters, my friends:
Let mischief cease, let pranks be done,
Lest you share the fate that I have won.

Thus, the otter's tale was spun.

**The Otter's Self-Sung Ballad**
"Kappa Reu Reu Kappa"

Kappa Reu Reu Kappa
One day, while playing along the stream,
Swimming down, I came to the water-drawing path
of Samayunkuru.
Samayunkuru's younger sister, beautiful as a goddess,
Was coming with a bucket in one hand and
A bundle of reeds in the other.
I poked my head out at the river's edge and said,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The girl, startled, looked around with wide eyes.
Upon finding me, she showed anger on her face,
Saying, "Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!..."
Then, large dogs came running out,
Baring their fangs at me. Startled, I dove to the river bottom
And immediately fled downstream along the riverbed.

Then, poking my head out at the mouth of the
water-drawing path of Okikirmui,
I saw Okikirmui's younger sister,
Beautiful as a goddess, coming with a bucket in one hand
And a bundle of reeds in the other.
I said to her,
"Do you have a father?
Do you have a mother?"
The girl, startled, looked around with wide eyes.
Upon finding me, she showed anger on her face,
Saying, "Oh, you hateful flathead, you wicked flathead,
Making fun of people! Dogs, here!..."
Then, large dogs came running out.
Seeing that, remembering what happened before,
I found it amusing and tried to dive to the river bottom
to escape.
But, never expecting the dogs to do such a thing,
They leaped at me, baring their fangs,
Even into the river bottom.
They dragged me ashore, biting and tearing at my head and body,
Until I lost consciousness of what happened.
When I came to,
I was sitting between the ears of a large otter.

I knew that neither Samayunkuru nor Okikirmui
Had a father or mother, and I played that prank,
So I was punished and killed by Okikirmui's dogs,
Dying a meaningless, bad death.
From now on, you otters, never play pranks.
So, the otter narrated.
