    "update_comment": "The original Chinese translation is generally accurate but lacks some of the directness and clarity present in both the Japanese and English versions. Specifically, \"吉祥\" (auspicious) is a reasonable interpretation of \"いい鳥\" (good bird), but \"good\" in this context seems more about its inherent qualities rather than its symbolic value. The English translation captures this nuance better with \"very good bird\". The English translation also provides the species name \"River Dipper\" which is helpful. The updated translation aims to incorporate these aspects."
