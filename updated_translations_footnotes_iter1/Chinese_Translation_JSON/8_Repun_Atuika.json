    "japanese_translation": "(1) 御幣で飾りをつけたものであって,神様にお神酒を上げる時に使います.この kike-ush-pashui は人間の代理を勤めて,人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います.御幣をつけていない普通の箸を iku pashui と云います(酒宴の箸).",
    "chinese_translation": "(1) 以御幣裝飾之物,於向神明獻上神酒時使用。此 kike-ush-pashui 擔任人類的代理,據說會將人類想對神明說的話傳達給神明。未裝飾御幣的普通筷子稱為 iku pashui(酒宴用筷)。\n",
    "english_translation": "(1) This is an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers), and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This *kike-ush-pashui* acts as a representative of humans, and it is said to go to the gods and convey what humans want to say to them. Ordinary chopsticks without *gohei* are called *iku pashui* (chopsticks for feasts).\n",
    "updated_chinese_translation": "(1) 這是用御幣（紙垂）裝飾的物品，用於向神明獻上神酒時。此 kike-ush-pashui 作為人類的代表，據說會將人類想對神明說的話傳達給神明。未裝飾御幣的普通筷子稱為 iku pashui (酒宴用筷，用於宴會)。",
    "update_comment": "The Chinese translation is generally accurate but can be improved by incorporating some of the clarity and flow of the English translation. Specifically, the phrase \"以御幣裝飾之物\" is a bit stiff and can be made more natural. The English translation's phrasing of \"acts as a representative of humans\" is clearer than \"擔任人類的代理\". Also, explicitly mentioning \"paper streamers\" for *gohei* is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the term. Finally, adding \"for feasts\" to the end of the sentence about *iku pashui* is helpful."
