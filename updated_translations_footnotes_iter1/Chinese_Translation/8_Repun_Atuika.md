### Prompt
```
You are translating the following Japanese text into Chinese. The original text is footnote. You already have a Chinese translation and an English translation.

Here are your tasks:

1. Criticise the Chinese translation based on the Japanese text. 
2. Compare the Chinese translation with the English translation.
3. Improve the Chinese translation, especially incoporating the pros of the English translation.

Keep the original meanings. For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form. Display in Traditional Chinese.

This is the Japanese text.
(1) 御幣で飾りをつけたものであって,神様にお神酒を上げる時に使います.この kike-ush-pashui は人間の代理を勤めて,人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います.御幣をつけていない普通の箸を iku pashui と云います(酒宴の箸).

This is the Chinese translation.
(1) 以御幣裝飾之物,於向神明獻上神酒時使用。此 kike-ush-pashui 擔任人類的代理,據說會將人類想對神明說的話傳達給神明。未裝飾御幣的普通筷子稱為 iku pashui(酒宴用筷)。


This is the English translation.
(1) This is an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers), and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This *kike-ush-pashui* acts as a representative of humans, and it is said to go to the gods and convey what humans want to say to them. Ordinary chopsticks without *gohei* are called *iku pashui* (chopsticks for feasts).


```

### Output
```
(1) 這是用御幣（紙垂）裝飾的物品，用於向神明獻上神酒時。此 kike-ush-pashui 作為人類的代表，據說會將人類想對神明說的話傳達給神明。未裝飾御幣的普通筷子稱為 iku pashui (酒宴用筷，用於宴會)。

The Chinese translation is generally accurate but can be improved by incorporating some of the clarity and flow of the English translation. Specifically, the phrase "以御幣裝飾之物" is a bit stiff and can be made more natural. The English translation's phrasing of "acts as a representative of humans" is clearer than "擔任人類的代理". Also, explicitly mentioning "paper streamers" for *gohei* is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the term. Finally, adding "for feasts" to the end of the sentence about *iku pashui* is helpful.
