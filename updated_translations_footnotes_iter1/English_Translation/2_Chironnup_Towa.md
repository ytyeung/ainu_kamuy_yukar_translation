(2) ononno.これは海に山に猟に出た人が何か獲物を持って帰って来た時にそれを迎える人が口々に言う言葉です.
(3) uniwente......大水害のあと,火災のあと,火山の破裂のあと,その他種々な天災のあったあとなどに,または人が熊に喰われたり,海や川に落ちたり,その他なにによらず変った事で負傷したり,死んだりした場合に行う儀式の事.
その時は槍や刀のさきを互いに突き合せながらお悔みの言葉を交します.一つの村に罹災者が出来ると,近所の村々から沢山の代表者がその村に集ってその儀式を行いますが,一人と一人でも致します.
(4) hokokse......uniwente の時,また大へんな変り事が出来た時に神様に救いを求める時の男の叫び声.フオホホーイと,これは男に限ります.
(5) ashur は変った話,ek は来る.
......村から遠い所に旅に出た人が病気したとか死んだとかした時にその所からその人の故郷へ使者がその変事を知らせに来るとか,外の村で誰々が死にましたとか,何々の変った事がありましたとかと村へ人が知らせに来る事を云います.
その使者を ashurkorkur(変った話を持つ人)と云います.
ashurkorkur は村の近くへ来た時に先ず大声をあげて hokokse(フオホホーイ)をします.すると,それをききつけた村人は,やはり大声で叫びながら村はずれまで出迎えてその変り事をききます.
(6) uchishkar......泣き合う.これは女の挨拶,長く別れていて久しぶりで会った時,近親の者が死んだ時,誰かがなにか大変な危険にあって,やっと免れた時などに,女どうしで手を取り合ったり,頭や肩を抱き合ったりして泣く事.
(7) matrimimse(女の叫び声)......何か急変の場合または uniwente の場合,男は hokokse(フオホホーイ)と太い声を出しますが,女はほそくホーイと叫びます.
女の声は男の声よりも高く強くひびくので神々の耳にも先にはいると云います.それで急な変事が起った時には,男でも女の様にほそい声を出して,二声三声叫びます.
(8) peutanke......rimimse と同じ意ですが,これは普通よく用いられる言葉で,rimimse の方は少し難かしい言葉になっています.

This is the Chinese translation.
(1) isoeonkami.iso 是海幸,eonkami 是......謝罪之意。
鯨魚擱淺在岸邊,人們深信不疑,這是海神大人為了賜予人類的禮物,親自帶來並推上岸的。此時,德高望重之人必會盛裝打扮,面向大海的方向進行禮拜。
(2) ononno. 這是出海或上山打獵的人,帶著獵物歸來時,迎接的人們異口同聲說出的話語。
(3) uniwente......大水災、火災、火山爆發等各種天災之後,或是有人被熊吃掉、落入海或河中,以及其他任何因變故而受傷或死亡的情況下所舉行的儀式。
屆時,人們會互相用槍或刀尖抵住對方,同時交換慰問之詞。一個村莊若有災民,鄰近村莊會派出許多代表聚集到該村莊舉行儀式，即使只有兩個人也會舉行。
(4) hokokse......uniwente 時,或發生重大變故時,向神明祈求救助時男性的呼喊聲。フオホホーイ,僅限男性。

......從村莊遠方出外旅行的人,生病或死亡時,該地會派遣使者將此變故告知其故鄉。或者，其他村莊的人會來告知本村，某某人過世了，或發生了某某變故等等。人們將這種情況稱為 ashur。
該使者被稱為 ashurkorkur(帶有變故消息的人)。
ashurkorkur 在靠近村莊時,首先會大聲呼喊 hokokse(フオホホーイ)。聽到呼喊聲的村民,也會大聲呼喊,並趕到村莊邊緣迎接,詢問變故的消息。
(6) uchishkar......互相哭泣。這是女性的寒暄方式,久別重逢時、近親過世時、有人遭遇重大危險好不容易脫險時等等,女性之間會手牽著手,或互相擁抱頭部或肩膀哭泣。
(7) matrimimse(女性的呼喊聲)......發生緊急情況或 uniwente 的情況時,男性會發出粗獷的 hokokse(フオホホーイ)聲,女性則會發出細微的ホーイ聲。
據說女性的聲音比男性的聲音更高亢響亮,因此能先傳入神明的耳中。因此,發生緊急變故時,即使是男性也會像女性一樣發出細微的聲音,呼喊兩三聲。
(8) peutanke......與 rimimse 相同的意思,但這是普通常用的詞彙,rimimse 則稍微是比較難的詞彙。

This is the English translation.
1.  isoeonkami.iso refers to the sea, eonkami refers to the act of apologizing for something.
It is believed that when a whale washes ashore, the Great God of the Sea brings it himself to give to humans, and washes it ashore. At that time, important people dress up formally and worship facing the sea.

2.  ononno. This is a word that people say repeatedly when someone returns from hunting in the mountains or at sea with some game.

3.  uniwente...... A ritual performed after a major flood, fire, volcanic eruption, or other natural disasters, or when someone is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies due to any unusual event.
At that time, they exchange words of condolence while pointing the tips of spears and swords at each other. When a disaster victim appears in one village, many representatives from neighboring villages gather in that village to perform the ritual, but it can also be done between two people.

4.  hokokse...... A man's cry to ask for help from the gods during uniwente or when a terrible event has occurred. "Hohho-i," and this is limited to men.

5.  ashur means unusual news, ek means to come.
......When someone who has traveled far from the village becomes ill or dies, a messenger comes from that place to the person's hometown to report the unusual event, or when someone comes to the village to report that someone has died in another village, or that something unusual has happened.
That messenger is called ashurkorkur (person with unusual news).
When ashurkorkur comes near the village, he first shouts loudly hokokse (Hohho-i). Then, the villagers who hear it also shout loudly and go out to the edge of the village to greet him and hear the unusual news.

6.  uchishkar...... Crying together. This is a woman's greeting, when they meet after a long separation, when a close relative has died, or when someone has been in great danger and has finally escaped, women hold hands or hug each other's heads or shoulders and cry.

7.  matrimimse (woman's cry)...... In case of a sudden change or in the case of uniwente, men make a loud voice of hokokse (Hohho-i), but women shout in a thin voice, "Ho-i."
It is said that women's voices are higher and stronger than men's voices, so they reach the ears of the gods first. Therefore, when a sudden event occurs, even men make a thin voice like women and shout two or three times.

8.  peutanke...... Has the same meaning as rimimse, but this is a commonly used word, while rimimse is a slightly difficult word.

### Output

1. isoeonkami.iso refers to the sea blessing (海幸), eonkami refers to the meaning of apology or expressing gratitude (謝罪之意).
It is believed that when a whale washes ashore, it is a gift from the Great God of the Sea, personally brought and delivered to the shore for humans. At that time, respected elders dress formally and offer worship facing the sea.

2. ononno. This is a word spoken in unison (異口同聲) by people welcoming hunters returning from the mountains or sea with their game.

3. uniwente...... A ritual performed after major floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, or other natural disasters, or when someone is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies due to any unusual event.
At that time, people exchange words of condolence while pointing the tips of spears and swords at each other. When a village experiences a disaster, many representatives from neighboring villages gather to perform the ritual, even if it's just between two people.

4. hokokse...... A man's cry for help from the gods during uniwente or when a terrible event occurs. "Hohho-i," and this is exclusively for men.

5. ashur means unusual news, ek means arrival.
......When someone traveling far from the village becomes ill or dies, a messenger is sent to their hometown to report this event. Alternatively, someone from another village may come to report a death or other unusual occurrence. This situation is referred to as ashur.
The messenger is called ashurkorkur (person bearing unusual news).
When ashurkorkur approaches the village, they first shout loudly hokokse (Hohho-i). Upon hearing this, the villagers also shout loudly and rush to the edge of the village to greet them and hear the news.

7. matrimimse (woman's cry)...... In case of a sudden event or during uniwente, men shout a loud hokokse (Hohho-i), while women shout a subtle "Ho-i" (細微的ホーイ).

Therefore, in emergencies, even men may use a thin voice like women and shout two or three times.

8. peutanke...... Has the same meaning as rimimse, but it is a commonly used word, while rimimse is a slightly more difficult word.

Overall, the English translation is good and conveys the general meaning of the Japanese text. However, it can be improved by incorporating some of the nuances present in the Chinese translation and by making the language more precise and natural.

Specific criticisms:

*   (1) "...to the act of apologizing for something" is a bit vague. The Chinese translation clarifies that it means "謝罪之意 (xie zui zhi yi)", meaning "the meaning of apology" or "with the intention of apology".
*   (2) "...people say repeatedly..." could be improved. The Chinese translation uses "異口同聲 (yi kou tong sheng)", meaning "in unison" or "with one voice".
*   (3) The English translation of uniwente is accurate but a bit wordy. The Chinese translation is more concise and reads more smoothly.
*   (5) The explanation of ashur is a bit repetitive. The Chinese translation is more concise and clear.
*   (6) "...has finally escaped" could be improved. The Chinese translation uses "好不容易脫險 (hao bu rong yi tuo xian)", meaning "barely escaped danger".
*   (7) "...in a thin voice, \"Ho-i.\"" could be more descriptive. The Chinese translation uses "細微的 (xi wei de)", meaning "a subtle/weak 'Ho-i' sound".

Comparison of Chinese and English translations:

The Chinese translation is generally more concise and captures the nuances of the Japanese text more effectively. It also uses more idiomatic expressions, making it sound more natural. The English translation is more literal, which sometimes results in a slightly awkward or less precise rendering.

Improvements:

The English translation can be improved by:

*   Adopting some of the more concise and idiomatic expressions from the Chinese translation.
*   Being more precise in the choice of words to better reflect the nuances of the Japanese text.
*   Streamlining the language to make it more readable and natural.
