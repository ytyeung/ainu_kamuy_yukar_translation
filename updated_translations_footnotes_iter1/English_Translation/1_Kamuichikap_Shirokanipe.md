Okay, let's analyze and improve the English translation based on the Japanese original and the Chinese translation.

**General Observations:**

*   The English translation is generally accurate but sometimes lacks the nuance and conciseness present in both the Japanese and Chinese. It can be a bit wordy.
*   The Chinese translation often captures the essence of the Japanese more succinctly.
*   The English translation sometimes misses opportunities to use more vivid or culturally appropriate language.

**Specific criticisms and improvements:**

**(1)** The English translation is fine. The Chinese translation is also good.

**(2)** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation is also good.

**(3)** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation is also good.

**(4)** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation is also good.

**(5)** The English translation is a bit wordy. The Chinese translation is more concise. Consider rephrasing for better flow and impact. For example, "...the owl ranks after the bear and wolf in importance." Also, "...not as rough or hasty as the mountain god..." is better than "not a rough and hasty person like the mountain god".

**(6)** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation is also good.

**(7)** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation is also good.

**(8)** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation is also good.

**(9)** The English translation is good. The Chinese translation is also good.
