```

### Prompt
```
You are translating the following Japanese text into English. The original text is footnote. You already have a Chinese translation and an English translation.

Here are your tasks:

1. Criticise the English translation based on the Japanese text. 
2. Compare the Chinese translation with the English translation.
3. Improve the English translation, especially incoporating the pros of the Chinese translation.

Keep the original meanings. For the text which are not in Japanese, keep the original form.

This is the Japanese text.
(1) 御幣で飾りをつけたものであって,神様にお神酒を上げる時に使います.この kike-ush-pashui は人間の代理を勤めて,人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います.御幣をつけていない普通の箸を iku pashui と云います(酒宴の箸).

This is the Chinese translation.
(1) 這是用御幣（紙垂）裝飾的物品，用於向神明獻上神酒時。此 kike-ush-pashui 作為人類的代表，據說會將人類想對神明說的話傳達給神明。未裝飾御幣的普通筷子稱為 iku pashui (酒宴用筷，用於宴會)。

This is the English translation.
(1) This is an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers), and it is used when offering sake to the gods. This *kike-ush-pashui* acts as a representative of humans, and it is said to go to the gods and convey what humans want to say to them. Ordinary chopsticks without *gohei* are called *iku pashui* (chopsticks for feasts).


```

### Output
```
(1) This is an ornament decorated with *gohei* (paper streamers), used when offering *sake* to the gods. This *kike-ush-pashui* acts as a representative of humans, conveying what humans want to say to the gods, delivering their messages directly to them. Ordinary chopsticks without *gohei* are called *iku pashui* (chopsticks for banquets, used in feasts).

The English translation is generally good but could be improved by being more specific and incorporating details from the Chinese translation. Specifically, the Chinese translation clarifies that '御幣' (gohei) is '紙垂' (paper streamers). Also, the Chinese translation explicitly states that *iku pashui* is used for banquets, which is a helpful clarification. The phrase "chopsticks for feasts" is a bit vague and could be improved. Finally, the English translation could benefit from a slightly more literal rendering of "人間が神様に云おうと思う事を神様のところへ行って,伝えると云います," to better capture the nuance of the original Japanese.
