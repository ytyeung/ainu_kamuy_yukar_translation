    "update_comment": "The existing English translation is inadequate as it simply states that there are no numbered items. It fails to translate the Japanese text, which is the core task. The Chinese translation acknowledges the need for the Japanese, Chinese, and English texts to fulfill the request, which is a more accurate interpretation of the Japanese. The improved English translation should reflect this need for the source texts.",
