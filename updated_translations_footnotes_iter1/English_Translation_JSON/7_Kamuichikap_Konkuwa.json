    "update_comment": "The English translation is a bit repetitive, especially with \"very good bird\". The Chinese translation is more concise and elegant. The phrase \"備受尊崇\" (bèi shòu zūn chóng) captures the nuance of being highly respected in a more sophisticated way than \"highly respected as a very good bird\". The updated translation will aim for conciseness and elegance, incorporating the spirit of the Chinese translation.",
    "updated_english_translation": "(1) katken......River Dipper. It is a bird highly revered since ancient times for its excellence."
