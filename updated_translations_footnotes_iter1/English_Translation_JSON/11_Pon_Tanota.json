    "update_comment": "The English translation is generally accurate but can be improved by being more specific and slightly more literal to capture the nuance of the Japanese and Chinese. The phrase \"six levels\" is a bit vague; \"six layers/levels of world\" is better. The Chinese translation is very close to the Japanese original. The improved translation will incorporate the specificity of the Chinese translation.",
