The Japanese text indicates that the original text, Chinese translation, and English translation are all needed for translation updates. The original English translation incorrectly states that there are no numbered items. The Chinese translation accurately reflects the meaning of the Japanese text. The improved English translation should be aligned with the Japanese and Chinese.",
