      "In days of old, when I spoke, my voice resonated like the twang of a bowstring wrapped in cherry bark, echoing through the very heart of the bow. But alas, I have grown old and feeble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, if there be any among you, eloquent and confident enough to serve as my messenger, I would entrust them with a crucial negotiation – a \"five and a half\" matter – to be delivered to the heavens!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I declared, tapping upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest. Just then, a voice called out from the entrance, \"Who could be more eloquent and confident than I to serve as your messenger?\" I turned to see a young raven standing there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I welcomed him inside and, tapping once more upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I began to explain the details of the negotiation, preparing the young raven for his mission. Three days passed, and as I was recounting the third point of the negotiation, I noticed the raven dozing off by the hearth. Enraged by his lack of attention, I seized him by his feathers and beat him to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I tapped upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest and cried out, \"Is there anyone confident enough to serve as my messenger, to carry this 'five and a half' matter to the heavens?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And again, a voice answered from the entrance, \"Who could be more eloquent than I, more worthy to stand as your messenger before the heavens?\" This time, it was a jay from the mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "I invited him in and, tapping once more upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I began to explain the \"five and a half\" negotiation. Four days passed, and as I was detailing the fourth point, I saw the mountain jay fast asleep by the hearth. My anger flared, and I seized the mountain jay by his feathers and beat him to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, I tapped upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest and proclaimed, \"If there be any among you, eloquent and confident enough to serve as my messenger, I would entrust them with this 'five and a half' matter to be delivered to the heavens!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This time, a figure entered with a humble demeanor. It was a young river crow, beautiful in appearance, who took a seat to my left. And so, tapping upon the lid of my *shintoko* chest, I continued to explain the \"five and a half\" matter, day and night. The young river crow listened without a hint of fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six days and nights we spent in this way, and as soon as I had finished speaking, he departed through the skylight and ascended to the heavens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essence of the negotiation was this: a famine had struck the human world, and the people were on the verge of starvation. The reason, it turned out, was that the gods who governed the deer and the fish in heaven had conspired to withhold their bounty. No matter how much they were entreated, they remained unmoved. Humans who hunted in the mountains found no deer, and those who fished in the rivers found no fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this, I was filled with righteous anger and sought to send a messenger to the deer god and the fish god.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many days passed, and then, a faint sound echoed from the sky. Someone entered, and it was the young river crow, now even more beautiful and imbued with a valiant spirit. He began to deliver the gods' response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deer god and the fish god had withheld their bounty because of the way humans treated the deer and the fish. When humans hunted deer, they would strike the deer's head with wood, skin it, and then leave the head discarded in the forest. When they caught fish, they would kill them by striking their heads with rotten wood. The deer, naked and weeping, would return to the deer god. The fish, with rotten wood still clutched in their mouths, would return to the fish god. The gods, enraged, had conspired to withhold their bounty.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if humans would promise to treat the deer and the fish with respect, then the deer god and the fish god would release their bounty once more. This was the message delivered by the deer god and the fish god.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, I praised the young river crow. And indeed, it was true that humans had been treating the deer and the fish with disrespect.\n",
      "\n",
      "From then on, I taught the humans in their dreams to never repeat such actions. The humans realized their wrongdoings and began to craft beautiful tools, like sacred *nusa* offerings, to catch the fish. When they hunted deer, they adorned the deer's head and offered it in sacrifice. The fish, delighted, carried the beautiful *gohei* offerings to the fish god. The deer, joyful, returned to the deer god with newly shaved forelocks. The deer god and the fish god were pleased and released their bounty in abundance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humans now lived without hardship or hunger, and I was at peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am old and feeble, and I had intended to ascend to the heavens. But I could not bear to leave the human realm, which I protect, while the people were suffering from famine. That is why I have remained until now. But now, with no more worries, I shall entrust the protection of the human world to the strongest and bravest among you, and ascend to the heavens.\n",
