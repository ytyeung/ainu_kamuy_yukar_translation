      "\n",
      "Long ago, this vast land of Hokkaido was the realm of freedom for our ancestors. Like innocent children, they were embraced by the beautiful nature, living leisurely and happily. Truly, they were nature's darlings, such blessed people they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "In winter, they kicked through the deep snow covering the forests, braving the freezing air that chilled the earth, crossing mountain after mountain to hunt bears. In summer, they sailed their leaf-like boats on the green waves where cool breezes swam, the songs of white gulls their companions, fishing all day long. In the blossoming spring, they basked in the soft sunlight, spending their days singing with the eternally chirping birds, gathering butterburs and mugwort. In the crimson autumn, they parted the fields of pampas grass, whose ears swayed in the autumn wind, until the bonfires for catching salmon faded into the evening. With the calls of deer echoing through the valleys, they dreamt beneath the round moon. Ah, what a joyous life!\n",
      "\n",
      "That peaceful world is now a thing of the past. Decades have passed since those dreams were shattered. This land has undergone rapid transformation, with mountains and fields gradually giving way to villages, and villages to towns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we knew it, the ancient face of nature has faded, and where have all the people who once lived joyfully in the fields and mountains gone? The few of our kin who remain can only stare in astonishment at the changing world. Yet, the beautiful souls of those ancient people, whose every action was governed by religious sentiment, are now gone from their eyes, replaced by anxiety and resentment, dulled and clouded, unable to see the way forward. They must rely on the mercy of others, a wretched sight. Oh, those who are dying out... that is our name now. What a sorrowful name we bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, our happy ancestors could never have imagined that their homeland would one day be reduced to such a miserable state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time flows ceaselessly, and the world advances infinitely. From among us, who are now exposing the ugliness of the defeated in this fierce arena of competition, perhaps someday two or three strong individuals will emerge, and the day will eventually come when we can keep pace with the advancing world. That is truly our ardent hope, and we pray for it morning and night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But... will all the many languages that our beloved ancestors used to communicate with each other daily, the ancient and beautiful words they passed down, all disappear along with the perishing weak? Oh, that is too heartbreaking and regrettable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Born an Ainu and raised within the Ainu language, I have written down in clumsy prose one or two of the very small stories from the many tales our ancestors used to gather and enjoy on rainy evenings and snowy nights whenever I had some free time.\n",
      "\n",
      "If many who know us can read this, I, along with our ancestors, will truly feel boundless joy and supreme happiness.\n",
