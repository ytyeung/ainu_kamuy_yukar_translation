However, it can be improved by incorporating some of the nuances present in the Chinese translation and by making the language more precise and natural.\\n\\nSpecific criticisms:\\n\\n*   (1) \\\"...to the act of apologizing for something\\\" is a bit vague. The Chinese translation clarifies that it means \\\"謝罪之意 (xie zui zhi yi)\\\", meaning \\\"the meaning of apology\\\" or \\\"with the intention of apology\\\".\\n*   (2) \\\"...people say repeatedly...\\\" could be improved. The Chinese translation uses \\\"異口同聲 (yi kou tong sheng)\\\", meaning \\\"in unison\\\" or \\\"with one voice\\\".\\n*   (3) The English translation of uniwente is accurate but a bit wordy. The Chinese translation is more concise and reads more smoothly.\\n*   (5) The explanation of ashur is a bit repetitive. The Chinese translation is more concise and clear.\\n*   (6) \\\"...has finally escaped\\\" could be improved. The Chinese translation uses \\\"好不容易脫險 (hao bu rong yi tuo xian)\\\", meaning \\\"barely escaped danger\\\".\\n*   (7) \\\"...in a thin voice, \\\\\\\"Ho-i.\\\\\\\"\\\" could be more descriptive. The Chinese translation uses \\\"細微的 (xi wei de)\\\", meaning \\\"a subtle/weak 'Ho-i' sound\\\".\\n\\nComparison of Chinese and English translations:\\n\\nThe Chinese translation is generally more concise and captures the nuances of the Japanese text more effectively. It also uses more idiomatic expressions, making it sound more natural. The English translation is more literal, which sometimes results in a slightly awkward or less precise rendering.\\n\\nImprovements:\\n\\nThe English translation can be improved by:\\n\\n*   Adopting some of the more concise and idiomatic expressions from the Chinese translation.\\n*   Being more precise in the choice of words to better reflect the nuances of the Japanese text.\\n*   Streamlining the language to make it more readable and natural.\",\n",

At that time, respected elders dress formally and offer worship facing the sea.\\n\\n2. ononno. This is a word spoken in unison (異口同聲) by people welcoming hunters returning from the mountains or sea with their game.\\n\\n3. uniwente...... A ritual performed after major floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, or other natural disasters, or when someone is eaten by a bear, falls into the sea or river, or is injured or dies due to any unusual event.\\nAt that time, people exchange words of condolence while pointing the tips of spears and swords at each other.

In case of a sudden event or during uniwente, men shout a loud hokokse (Hohho-i), while women shout a subtle \\\"Ho-i\\\" (細微的ホーイ). It is said that women's voices are higher and more resonant than men's, reaching the gods' ears first.
