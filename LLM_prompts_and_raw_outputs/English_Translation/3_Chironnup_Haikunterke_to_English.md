狐が自ら歌った謡
「ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ」

ハイクンテレケ ハイコシテムトリ
国の岬,神の岬の上に
私は坐して居りました.
ある日に外へ出て見ますと
海は凪なぎてひろびろとしていて,海の上に
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカとサマユンクルが
海猟に三人乗りで出かけています,それを見た私は
私の持ってる悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上をずーっと上へずーっと下へ
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけ出しました.
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパーウ,パウと叫び
この川の水源をにらみにらみ暴風の魔を
呼びました.すると,それにつれてこの川の
水源から烈しい風,つむじ風が
吹き出して海にはいると直ぐに
この海は,上の海が下になり
下の海が上になりました.オキキリムイたち
の漁舟は沖の人の海と,陸の人の海との
出会ったところ(海の中程)に,非常な急変に会って波の間を
クルリと廻りました.大きな浪が山の様に
舟の上へかぶさり寄ります.すると,
オキキリムイ,サマユンクル,シュプンラムカは
声をふるって,舟を漕ぎました.
この小さい舟は落葉の飛ぶ様に吹き飛ばされ
今にもくつがえりそうになるけれども
感心にも人間たちは力強くて
この小舟は風の中に
波の上をすべります.
それを見ると私の持っている悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり,
重い調子で木片がポキリポキリと折れる様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔を声援するのみに精を出しました.
そうしてる中に,やっと,サマユンクルが
手の上から,手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれました.
そのさまを見て私はひそかに笑いを浮べました.
それからまた,精を出して
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
重い調子で木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
暴風の魔を声援しました.
オキキリムイとシュプンラムカと二人で
励まし合いながら勇ましく舟を漕いで
居りましたが,と,ある時シュプンラムカは
手の上から手の下から血が流れて
疲れてたおれてしまいました,それを見て
ひそかに私は笑いました.
それからまた軽い足取りで腰やわらかに
飛びまわり重い調子でかたい木片を
ポキリポキリと折る様に叫び精を出しました.
けれども,オキキリムイは疲れた様子は少しも無い.
一枚の薄物を体にまとい,
舟を漕いでいます,そのうちに
手の下でその持っていた楫、第3水準1-86-21)が折れてしまいました.
すると,疲れ死んだサマユンクルに
躍りかかりその持っている楫、第3水準1-86-21)をもぎとってたった一人で
舟を漕ぎました.
私はそれを見ると,持前の悪い心がむらむらと出て来ました.
重い調子でかたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様に叫び
軽い足取りで腰やわらかにかけまわり
精を出して暴風の魔に声援しました.
そうしてるうちにサマユンクルの舵も
折れてしまいました.オキキリムイはシュプンラムカに
躍りかかりその※(「楫+戈」、第3水準1-86-21)をとって
勇ましく舟を漕ぎました.
けれども彼の※(「楫+戈」、第3水準1-86-21)も波に折られてしまいました.
そこで,オキキリムイは舟の中に
立ちつくして,烈しい風のうちに
まさか人間の彼が私を見つけようとは
思わなかったに,国の岬,神の岬の
上の,私の眼の央を見つめました.
今までやさしかった顔に怒りの色を
あらわして,鞄をいじっていたが
中から出したものを見ると,蓬よもぎの小弓と
蓬の小矢を取り出しました.
それを見てひそかに私は笑いました.
「人間なぞ何をしたって,恐い事があるものか,
あんな蓬の小矢は何に使うものだろう.」
と思ってこの岬
国の岬,神の岬の上を
ずーっと上へずーっと下へ軽い足取りで
腰やわらかにかけまわり,重い調子で
かたい木片をポキリポキリと折る様にパウ,パウと叫び
暴風の魔をほめたたえました.
その中にオキキリムイの射放した矢が飛んで来ましたが
ちょうど私の襟首えりくびのところへ突きささりました.
それっきりあとどうなったか解らなくなってしまいました.
ふと気がついて見ると
大そう好いお天気で,海の上は
広々として,オキキリムイの漁舟もなにもありません.
どうした事か私の頭のさきから
足のさきまで雁皮が燃え縮む様に痛みます.
まさか人間の射た小さな矢がこんなに私を苦しめ
ようとは思わなかったのに,それから手足をもがき苦しみ
この岬,国の岬,神の岬
の上を,ずーっと上へ,ずーっと下へ泣き叫びながら
もがき苦しみ,昼でも夜でも生きたり
死んだり,している中に,どうしたか
わからなくなりました.
ふと気がついて見ると,
大きな黒狐の耳と耳との間に私は居りました.
二日ほどたった時,オキキリムイが神様の様な様子で
やって来て,ニコニコ笑って言うことには,
「まあ見ばのよい事,国の岬,神の岬
の上を見守る黒狐の神様は,
善い心,神の心を持っていたから
死にざまの見ばのよい死方をしたのですね.」
言いながら私の頭を取って,
自分の家へ持って行き私の上顎の骨を
自分の便所のどだいとし,私の下顎を
その妻の便所の礎として,
私のからだはそのまま土と共に腐ってしまいました.
それから夜でも昼でも
悪い臭気に苦しんでいる中に私はつまらない死方,悪い
死方をしました.
ただの身分の軽い神でもなかったのですが
大変な悪い心を私は持っていた為なんにも
ならない,悪い死方を私はしたのですから
これからの狐たちよ,決して
悪い心を持ちなさるな.

と狐の神様が物語りました.

Okay, here's a translation of the Japanese poem into English, aiming for a poetic feel while maintaining the original meaning:

**The Fox's Own Lament**

*"Haikun tereke, haikoshi temtori"*

Haikun tereke, haikoshi temtori,
Upon the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
I sat in my domain.
One day, I ventured forth to gaze,
The sea was calm, a boundless expanse, and upon it,
Okikirmui, Shupunramka, and Samayunkur,
Sailed as three for a sea hunt. Seeing this,
The wicked heart within me stirred and rose.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, up and down,
With nimble steps and swaying waist, I ran.
In heavy tones, like snapping wood, *pau, pau*, I cried,
And glared at the source of the river, summoning the storm's demon.
Then, in response, from the river's source,
A fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Burst forth and rushed into the sea, and instantly,
The sea above became the sea below,
The sea below became the sea above. Okikirmui's
Fishing boat, at the meeting place of the sea of men offshore and the sea of men on land,
Met with a sudden change, and spun amidst the waves.
A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed down upon the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkur, Shupunramka,
Raised their voices and rowed with all their might.
The small boat, like a falling leaf, was blown away,
On the verge of capsizing, yet
Admirably, the humans were strong,
And the small boat, in the wind,
Glided upon the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked heart within me stirred and rose.
With nimble steps and swaying waist, I ran about,
In heavy tones, like snapping wood, *pau, pau*, I cried,
And devoted myself to cheering on the storm's demon.
As this went on, at last, Samayunkur,
Blood flowed from his hands, above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then again, I devoted myself,
With nimble steps and swaying waist, I ran about,
In heavy tones, like snapping wood, I cried,
And cheered on the storm's demon.
Okikirmui and Shupunramka, the two of them,
Encouraging each other, bravely rowed,
But then, at one point, Shupunramka,
Blood flowed from his hands, above and below,
And he collapsed, exhausted. Seeing this,
Secretly, I smiled.
Then again, with nimble steps and swaying waist,
I leaped about, in heavy tones, like snapping hard wood,
I cried, and devoted myself.
But Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With a single thin cloth wrapped around his body,
He rowed. Then,
The oar in his hand snapped.
Then, leaping upon the exhausted Samayunkur,
He seized his oar and rowed alone.
Seeing this, the wicked heart within me stirred and rose.
In heavy tones, like snapping hard wood, I cried,
With nimble steps and swaying waist, I ran about,
And devoted myself to cheering on the storm's demon.
As this went on, Samayunkur's rudder also
Snapped. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunramka,
Seized his oar,
And bravely rowed.
But his oar was also broken by the waves.
Then, Okikirmui, in the boat,
Stood still, in the fierce wind,
Never imagining that a human could find me,
He gazed into the center of my eyes, on the cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His gentle face now showing anger,
He fiddled with his bag,
And from within, he took out a small mugwort bow,
And a small mugwort arrow.
Seeing this, secretly, I smiled.
"What can a human do? Is there anything to fear?
What use is such a mugwort arrow?"
Thinking this, on this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, up and down, with nimble steps,
And swaying waist, I ran about, in heavy tones,
Like snapping hard wood, *pau, pau*, I cried,
And praised the storm's demon.
Then, the arrow shot by Okikirmui flew,
And pierced me right at the nape of my neck.
After that, I knew nothing more.
Suddenly, I awoke to find
The weather was fair, the sea
Was vast, and Okikirmui's fishing boat was gone.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, it burned and shrank like Daphne bark.
Never imagining that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so, I writhed in agony,
On this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, up and down, crying out,
Writhing in agony, living and
Dying, day and night, until I
Lost all sense of what was happening.
Suddenly, I awoke to find myself
Between the ears of a great black fox.
Two days later, Okikirmui came, looking like a god,
And said with a smile,
"How beautiful! The black fox god, watching over
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Had a good heart, a god's heart,
And so died a beautiful death."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it to his house, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the foundation of his wife's toilet.
My body rotted with the earth.
Then, night and day,
Suffering from the foul stench, I died a meaningless, bad
Death.
Though I was not just a low-ranking god,
Because I had such a wicked heart, I died a useless, bad
Death.
Therefore, you foxes of the future, never
Harbor a wicked heart.

So the fox god lamented.

**The Fox's Self-Sung Ballad**
"Haikun Tereke Haikoshite Mutori"

Haikun Tereke Haikoshite Mutori
On the cape of the land, upon the cape of the gods,
I was seated.
One day, I went outside to look,
The sea was calm and vast, and upon the sea,
Okikirmui, Shupunramuka, and Samayunkuru
Were out on a sea hunt, three in a boat. Seeing this,
The wicked heart within me stirred.
This cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, up and down,
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about.
In a heavy tone, as if snapping wood into pieces, I shouted "Pau, Pau!"
And glared at the source of this river, summoning the demon of the storm.
Then, in response, from the source of this river,
A fierce wind, a whirlwind,
Burst forth and entered the sea, and immediately
This sea, the upper sea became the lower,
And the lower sea became the upper. Okikirmui and the others'
Fishing boat, at the meeting point of the sea of people offshore and the sea of people on land (mid-sea),
Encountered a sudden change and spun around in the waves.
A great wave, like a mountain,
Crashed down upon the boat. Then,
Okikirmui, Samayunkuru, and Shupunramuka
Raised their voices and rowed the boat.
This small boat was blown about like a falling leaf,
And seemed about to capsize, but
Admirably, the humans were strong, and
This small boat glided through the wind,
Upon the waves.
Seeing this, the wicked heart within me stirred.
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
In a heavy tone, as if snapping wood into pieces, I shouted "Pau, Pau!"
And devoted myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
While this was happening, finally, Samayunkuru
Had blood flowing from above and below his hands,
And collapsed from exhaustion.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
Then again, I devoted myself,
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
In a heavy tone, as if snapping wood into pieces, I shouted,
And cheered on the demon of the storm.
Okikirmui and Shupunramuka, the two of them,
Encouraged each other and bravely rowed the boat,
But then, at one point, Shupunramuka
Had blood flowing from above and below his hands,
And collapsed from exhaustion. Seeing this,
I secretly smiled.
Then again, with light steps and a supple waist,
I leaped about, and in a heavy tone, as if snapping hard wood into pieces,
I shouted and devoted myself.
However, Okikirmui showed no sign of fatigue.
With a single thin garment wrapped around his body,
He rowed the boat. In the meantime,
The oar he was holding broke in his hand.
Then, he leaped upon the exhausted and dying Samayunkuru,
Snatched the oar he was holding, and rowed the boat alone.
When I saw this, the wicked heart within me stirred.
In a heavy tone, as if snapping hard wood into pieces, I shouted,
With light steps and a supple waist, I ran about,
And devoted myself to cheering on the demon of the storm.
While this was happening, Samayunkuru's rudder also
Broke. Okikirmui leaped upon Shupunramuka
And took his oar,
And bravely rowed the boat.
However, his oar was also broken by the waves.
Thereupon, Okikirmui stood
Motionless in the boat, and in the midst of the fierce wind,
Never imagining that a human like him could find me,
He stared at the center of my eyes, on the
Cape of the land, the cape of the gods.
His face, which had been gentle until now, showed anger,
And he fiddled with a bag,
And when he took something out of it, it was a small bow of mugwort
And a small arrow of mugwort.
Seeing this, I secretly smiled.
"What is there to fear from humans?
What could he possibly use such a mugwort arrow for?"
Thinking this, on this cape,
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, up and down, with light steps,
And a supple waist, I ran about, and in a heavy tone,
As if snapping hard wood into pieces, I shouted "Pau, Pau!"
And praised the demon of the storm.
In the midst of this, the arrow that Okikirmui shot flew and
Stuck right into the back of my neck.
After that, I didn't know what happened.
When I suddenly came to,
The weather was very fine, and the sea was
Vast, and there was no sign of Okikirmui's fishing boat.
What had happened? From the tip of my head
To the tip of my toes, it hurt as if daphne bark was burning and shrinking.
I never imagined that a small arrow shot by a human could torment me so much.
Then, writhing in agony,
On this cape, the cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Up and down, up and down, screaming and
Writhing in agony, living and
Dying, day and night, in the midst of this, I didn't know
What had happened.
When I suddenly came to,
I was between the ears of a large black fox.
Two days or so later, Okikirmui came, looking like a god,
And said with a smile,
"Well, what a fine sight! The black fox god who watches over
The cape of the land, the cape of the gods,
Had a good heart, a god's heart,
So he died a fine death, a death that is good to see."
Saying this, he took my head,
Brought it to his house, and used my upper jawbone
As the foundation of his toilet, and my lower jaw
As the cornerstone of his wife's toilet,
And my body rotted away with the earth.
From then on, day and night,
Suffering from a foul stench, I died a worthless death, a bad
Death.
I was not just a god of low rank, but
Because I had a terribly wicked heart, I died a useless,
Bad death.
Therefore, you foxes of the future, never
Harbor a wicked heart.

So the fox god narrated.
