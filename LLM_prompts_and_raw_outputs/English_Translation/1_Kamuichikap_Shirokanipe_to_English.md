梟の神の自ら歌った謡
「銀の滴しずく降る降るまわりに」

「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,金の滴
降る降るまわりに.」という歌を私は歌いながら
流に沿って下り,人間の村の上を
通りながら下を眺めると
昔の貧乏人が今お金持になっていて,昔のお金持が
今の貧乏人になっている様です.
海辺に人間の子供たちがおもちゃの小弓に
おもちゃの小矢をもってあそんで居ります.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながら子供等の上を
通りますと,(子供等は)私の下を走りながら
云うことには,
「美しい鳥! 神様の鳥!
さあ,矢を射てあの鳥
神様の鳥を射当てたものは,一ばんさきに取った者は
ほんとうの勇者,ほんとうの強者だぞ.」
云いながら,昔貧乏人で今お金持になってる者の
子供等は,金の小弓に金の小矢を
番つがえて私を射ますと,金の小矢を
私は下を通したり上を通したりしました.
その中に,子供等の中に
一人の子供がただの(木製の)小弓にただの小矢
を持って仲間にはいっています.私はそれを見ると
貧乏人の子らしく,着物でも
それがわかります.けれどもその眼色を
よく見ると,えらい人の子孫らしく,一人変り
者になって仲間入りをしています.自分もただの小弓に
ただの小矢を番えて私をねらいますと,
昔貧乏人で今お金持の子供等は大笑いをして
云うには,
「あらおかしや貧乏の子
あの鳥,神様の鳥は私たちの
金の小矢でもお取りにならないものを,お前の様な
貧乏な子のただの矢腐れ木の矢を
あの鳥,神様の鳥がよくよく
取るだろうよ.」
と云って,貧しい子を足蹴にしたり
たたいたりします.けれども貧乏な子は
ちっとも構わず私をねらっています.
私はそのさまを見ると,大層不憫に思いました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」という歌を
歌いながらゆっくりと大空に
私は輪をえがいていました.貧乏な子は
片足を遠く立て片足を近くたてて,
下唇をグッと噛みしめて,ねらっていて
ひょうと射放しました.小さい矢は美しく飛んで
私の方へ来ました,それで私は手を
差しのべてその小さい矢を取りました.
クルクルまわりながら私は
風をきって舞い下りました.
すると,彼かの子供たちは走って
砂吹雪をたてながら競争しました.
土の上に私が落ちると一しょに,一等先に
貧乏な子がかけついて私を取りました.
すると,昔貧乏人で今は金持になってる者の
子供たちは後から走って来て
二十も三十も悪口をついて
貧乏な子を押したりたたいたり
「にくらしい子,貧乏人の子
私たちが先にしようとする事を先がけしやがって.」
と云うと,貧乏な子は,私の上に
おおいかぶさって,自分の腹にしっかりと私を押えていました.
もがいてもがいてやっとの事,人の隙から
飛び出しますと,それから,どんどんかけ出しました.
昔は貧乏人で今は金持の子供等が
石や木片を投げつけるけれど
貧乏な子はちっとも構わず
砂吹雪をたてながらかけて来て一軒の小屋の
表へ着きました.子供は
第一の窗から私を入れて,それに
言葉を添え,斯々かくかくのありさまを物語りました.
家の中から老夫婦が
眼の上に手をかざしながらやって来て
見ると,大へんな貧乏人ではあるけれども
紳士らしい淑女らしい品をそなえています,
私を見ると,腰の央なかをギックリ屈めて,ビックリしました.
老人はキチンと帯をしめ直して,
私を拝し
「ふくろうの神様,大神様,
貧しい私たちの粗末な家へ
お出で下さいました事,有難う御座います.
昔は,お金持に自分を数え入れるほどの者で
御座いましたが今はもうこの様に
つまらない貧乏人になりまして,国の神様
大神様をお泊め申すも
畏れ多い事ながら今日はもう
日も暮れましたから,今宵は大神様を
お泊め申し上げ,明日は,ただイナウだけでも
大神様をお送り申し上げましょう.」という事を
申しながら何遍も何遍も礼拝を重ねました.
老婦人は,東の窗の下に
敷物をしいて私をそこへ置きました.
それからみんな寝ると直ぐに高いびきで
寝入ってしまいました.
私は私の体の耳と耳の間に坐って
いましたがやがて,ちょうど,真夜中時分に
起き上りました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌を静かにうたいながら
この家の左の座へ右の座へ
美しい音をたてて飛びました.
私が羽ばたきをすると,私のまわりに
美しい宝物,神の宝物が美しい音をたてて
落ち散りました.
一寸のうちに,この小さい家を,りっぱな宝物
神の宝物で一ぱいにしました.
「銀の滴降る降るまわりに,
金の滴降る降るまわりに.」
という歌をうたいながらこの小さい家を
一寸の間にかねの家,大きな家に
作りかえてしまいました,家の中は,りっぱな宝物の積場
を作り,りっぱな着物の美しいのを
早つくりして家の中を飾りつけました.
富豪の家よりももっとりっぱにこの大きな家の
中を飾りつけました.私はそれを終ると
もとのままに私の冑の
耳と耳の間に坐っていました.
家の人たちに夢を見せて
アイヌのニシパが運が悪くて貧乏人になって
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている者たちに
ばかにされたりいじめられたりしてるさまを私が見て
不憫に思ったので,私は身分の卑しいただの神では
ないのだが,人間の家
に泊って,恵んでやったのだという事を
知らせました.
それが済んで少したって夜が明けますと
家の人々が一しょに起きて
目をこすりこすり家の中を見るとみんな
床の上に腰を抜かしてしまいました.老婦人は
声を上げて泣き,老人は
大粒の涙をポロポロこぼして
いましたが,やがて,老人は起き上り
私の処へ来て,二十も三十も礼拝
を重ねて,そして云う事には,
「ただの夢ただの眠りをしたのだと
思ったのに,ほんとうに,こうしていただいた事.
つまらないつまらない,私共の粗末な家に
お出で下さるだけでも有難く存じますものを
国の神様,大神様,私たちの不運な
事を哀れんで下さいまして
お恵みのうちにも最も大きいお恵みをいただき
ました事.」と云う事を泣きながら
申しました.
それから,老人はイナウの木をきり
りっぱなイナウを美しく作って私を飾りました.
老婦人は身仕度をして
小さい子を手伝わせ,薪をとったり
水を汲んだりして,酒を造る仕度をして,一寸の間に
六つの酒樽を上座にならべました.
それから私は火の老女,老女神と
種々な神の話を語り合いました.
二日程たつと,神様の好物ですから
はや,家の中に酒の香が
漂いました.
そこで,あの小さい子に態わざと
古い衣物を着せて,村中の
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々を
招待するため使いに出してやりました.ので
後見送ると,子供は家毎に
入って使いの口上を述べますと
昔貧乏人で今お金持になっている人々は
大笑いをして
「これはふしぎ,貧乏人どもが
どんな酒を造ってどんな
御馳走があってそのため人を招待するのだろう,
行ってどんな事があるか見物して
笑ってやりましょう.」と
言い合いながら大勢打ち連れて
やって来て,ずーっと遠くから,ただ家を見ただけで
驚いてはずかしがり,そのまま帰る者もあります,
家の前まで来て腰を抜かしているのもあります.
すると,家の夫人が外へ出て
人皆の手を取って家へ入れますと,
みんないざり這いよって
顔を上げる者もありません.
すると,家の主人は起き上って
カッコウ鳥の様な美しい声で物を言いました.
斯々かくかくの訳を物語り
「この様に,貧乏人でへだてなく
互に往来も出来なかったのだが
大神様があわれんで下され,何の悪い考えも
私どもは持っていませんのでしたのでこの様に
お恵みをいただきましたのですから
今から村中,私共は一族の者
なんですから,仲善くして
互に往来をしたいという事を皆様に
望む次第であります.」という事を
申し述べると,人々は
何度も何度も手をすりあわせて
家の主人に罪を謝し,これからは
仲よくする事を話し合いました.
私もみんなに拝されました.
それが済むと,人はみな,心が柔らいで
盛んな酒宴を開きました.
私は,火の神様や家の神様や
御幣ごへい棚の神様と話し合いながら
人間たちの舞を舞ったり躍りをしたりするさまを
眺めて深く興がりました.そして
二日三日たつと酒宴は終りました.
人間たちが仲の善いありさまを
見て,私は安心をして
火の神,家の神
御幣棚の神に別れを告げました.
それが済むと私は自分の家へ帰りました.
私の来る前に,私の家は美しい御幣
美酒が一ぱいになっていました.
それで近い神,遠い神に
使者をたてて招待し,盛んな酒宴を
張りました,席上,神様たちへ
私は物語り,人間の村を訪問した時の
その村の状況,その出来事を詳しく話しますと
神様たちは大そう私をほめたてました.
神様たちが帰る時に美しい御幣を
二つやり三つやりしました.
彼かのアイヌ村の方を見ると,
今はもう平穏で,人間たちは
みんな仲よく,彼のニシパが
村に頭になっています,
彼の子供は,今はもう,成人
して,妻ももち子も持って
父や母に孝行をしています,
何時でも何時でも,酒を造った時は
酒宴のはじめに,御幣やお酒を私に送ってよこします.
私も人間たちの後に坐して
何時でも
人間の国を守護まもっています.
と,ふくろうの神様が物語りました.

Here's a translation of the poem, aiming for a balance between accuracy and a poetic feel:

**The Owl God's Own Song**

"Silver drops fall, fall around,
Golden drops fall, fall around."

Singing this song, I drift along the stream,
Looking down on human villages below.
The poor of yesterday are rich today, it seems,
The rich of yesterday, now bowed in woe.

By the shore, children play with toy bows and arrows,
"Silver drops fall, fall around,
Golden drops fall, fall around."
Singing, I pass above them, shadows.

They run beneath me, shouting in glee,
"A beautiful bird! A god's own bird!
Come, shoot an arrow! He who strikes it, see,
The god's own bird, is bravest, strongest, heard!"

The children of the newly rich, with golden bows,
And golden arrows, aim and let fly.
I weave and dodge, above, below,
Their gilded shafts against the sky.

Among them, one child, with a simple, wooden bow,
And simple arrow, joins the fray.
A pauper's child, his clothes betray,
Yet in his eyes, a noble fire glows.

He aims his humble weapon, too,
The rich children laugh, a cruel sound,
"Oh, look at the pauper! What can he do?
Our golden arrows the god disdains, unbound.

"Will he take your wretched, rotten wood?
That bird, that god, would never deign!"
They kick and shove, misunderstood,
But the poor child aims again.

I see his plight, and pity stirs within,
"Silver drops fall, fall around,
Golden drops fall, fall around."
Singing, I circle, a slow, wide spin.

The poor child stands, one foot far, one near,
Biting his lip, he takes his aim,
And lets his simple arrow clear,
It flies to me, a slender flame.

I reach a hand, and catch it in the air,
Spinning, I dive, a whirlwind's grace,
The children race, a dusty prayer,
To claim the prize, to win the race.

I fall to earth, and with me, he arrives,
The poor child first, he seizes me tight.
The rich children follow, with angry hives,
Of insults hurled, with all their might.

"Hateful child! Pauper's brat!
You stole what should have been our own!"
He clutches me close, where he sat,
Against his belly, safe and known.

He struggles free, and runs away,
The rich children throw stones and wood,
But he cares not, he will not stay,
He reaches a hut, misunderstood.

He slips me through a window small,
And tells his tale, with earnest plea.
An old couple comes, answering his call,
Poor, yet with dignity.

They see me, bow low, with creaking spine,
The old man straightens his worn sash,
"Owl God, Great God, divine,
To our humble home, you bring your flash.

"We were once counted among the wealthy,
But now are poor, and low in state.
To house a god, it is unhealthy,
But night has fallen, it is late.

"Tonight, Great God, you will stay,
Tomorrow, with simple *inaw* we'll send you on your way."
He bows again, and again, they pray.
The old woman spreads a mat, where I may lay.

They sleep, and soon, their snores arise,
I sit between my feathered ears,
And at the stroke of midnight skies,
I wake, and banish all their fears.

"Silver drops fall, fall around,
Golden drops fall, fall around."
Singing softly, I fly, without a sound,
From left to right, within the bound.

My wings beat softly, and around me, fall,
Treasures of the gods, a shining rain.
In moments, I fill the cottage small,
With wealth untold, again, again.

"Silver drops fall, fall around,
Golden drops fall, fall around."
Singing, I transform the humble place,
Into a mansion, grand and profound.

I fill it with treasures, beyond compare,
With beautiful clothes, swiftly made,
More splendid than any rich man's lair,
Then return to my perch, unafraid.

I send them dreams, of an Ainu *niskipa*,
Unlucky, poor, and scorned by all,
And how I saw his plight, so bitter,
And came to help him stand up tall.

I, a humble god, yet more than that,
Stayed in their home, and gave my grace.
When dawn arrives, they rise from their mat,
And rub their eyes, in disbelief's embrace.

The old woman cries, a joyful sound,
The old man weeps, with tears that fall,
He rises, comes to me, profound,
And bows again, surpassing all.

"We thought it but a dream, a fleeting sleep,
But it is true, this wondrous thing!
To visit our poor home, so humble, deep,
Is grace enough, your presence sing!

"Great God, you pitied our despair,
And gave us gifts beyond compare!"
He cries, and tells his heartfelt prayer.
Then, he carves *inaw*, with loving care.

The old woman prepares, with helping hand,
To gather wood, and draw the water clear,
To brew the sake, throughout the land,
Six barrels line the upper tier.

I speak with the Fire Old Woman, and the gods,
Of ancient tales, and mysteries untold.
Two days pass, and through the sods,
The scent of sake, a story to unfold.

They dress the small child in clothes of old,
And send him forth, to every door,
To invite the rich, with stories bold,
The newly rich, who scorned the poor.

They laugh, and say, "How strange a thing!
The paupers brew, what feast is there?
Let us go see, and mocking sing,
And laugh at them, beyond compare!"

They come in droves, but from afar,
They see the house, and gasp in shame,
Some turn away, beneath a star,
Some reach the door, and whisper my name.

The old woman comes, and takes their hand,
And leads them in, with gentle grace,
They crawl inside, across the land,
And dare not lift a humble face.

The old man rises, with a voice so clear,
Like the cuckoo's call, he tells his tale,
"We were divided, filled with fear,
But the Great God saw, beyond the veil.

"We held no malice, in our hearts,
And so, received this wondrous boon.
From now on, we will play our parts,
As kin, united, 'neath the moon.

"We ask you now, to be as one,
To share our lives, and walk as friends."
They clasp their hands, their wrongs undone,
And beg forgiveness, amends.

They bow to me, their hearts now light,
And start a feast, with joyful sound.
I speak with the Fire God, through the night,
And watch them dance, upon the ground.

I watch the humans dance and play,
And find my heart with joy replete.
Two days and nights then slip away,
The feast is done, the circle complete.

I see the humans, hand in hand,
And know that peace has found its home.
I bid farewell, across the land,
To Fire God, and the gods of loam.

I return to my home, above the trees,
Where offerings wait, a welcome sight.
I call the gods, on every breeze,
And hold a feast, with all my might.

I tell them tales, of the human village,
Of all I saw, and all I did.
The gods applaud, my deeds to pillage,
And praise my name, as I bid.

As they depart, I give them gifts,
Of *inaw* fair, a token true.
I look upon the Ainu rifts,
And see a village, born anew.

Now all is peace, and harmony,
The humans live in gentle grace,
The *niskipa* leads, for all to see,
And guides his people, in this place.

His son is grown, with wife and child,
He honors parents, old and gray,
And when they brew, with spirits mild,
They send me offerings, every day.

I sit behind them, ever near,
And watch over the human land,
Protecting them from every fear,
With watchful eye, and steady hand.

So spoke the Owl God, wise and old,
His tale complete, his story told.

The Owl God's Own Song:
"Silver droplets fall, fall all around."

While singing the song, "Silver droplets fall, fall all around, golden droplets fall, fall all around," I descended along the river, passing over a human village. Looking down, I saw that the poor of old had become rich, and the rich of old had become poor.

On the beach, human children were playing with toy bows and arrows. As I passed over them, singing "Silver droplets fall, fall all around, golden droplets fall, fall all around," the children ran beneath me, saying,

"A beautiful bird! A god's bird! Come on, shoot that bird! Whoever shoots down that god's bird first is a true hero, a true strongman!"

As they said this, the children of those who were once poor but now rich nocked golden arrows to golden bows and shot at me. I dodged the golden arrows, passing above and below them.

Among the children, one child was there with only a plain (wooden) bow and arrow, joining the group. When I saw him, I could tell he was the child of a poor family, even from his clothes. But looking closely at his eyes, he seemed to be a descendant of a great person, an odd one joining the group. He, too, nocked his plain bow and arrow and aimed at me.

The children of those who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly, saying,

"How funny, a poor child! That bird, that god's bird, won't even take notice of our golden arrows, so why would it ever take a plain, rotten wooden arrow from a poor child like you?"

They kicked and hit the poor child. But the poor child paid no attention and kept aiming at me. Seeing this, I felt deeply sorry for him.

Singing "Silver droplets fall, fall all around, golden droplets fall, fall all around," I slowly drew circles in the sky. The poor child stood with one foot far back and one foot close, biting his lower lip, aiming, and then he let fly. The small arrow flew beautifully towards me, and I reached out my hand and caught it.

Spinning around and around, I cut through the wind and descended. Then, the children ran, kicking up sandstorms as they raced. As I fell to the ground, the poor child was the first to reach me.

Then, the children of those who were once poor but now rich ran up from behind, hurling twenty or thirty insults, pushing and hitting the poor child, saying,

"Hateful child, poor child! You took what we were going to do first!"

The poor child covered me, pressing me firmly against his stomach. Struggling and struggling, he finally broke free from the crowd and ran away.

The children of those who were once poor but now rich threw stones and pieces of wood at him, but the poor child paid no attention, running through the sandstorm until he reached the front of a small hut. The child put me through the first window, adding words, telling the story of what had happened.

From inside the house, an old couple came out, shading their eyes with their hands. They were very poor, but they possessed the dignity of a gentleman and a lady. When they saw me, they bent deeply at the waist, surprised.

The old man straightened his belt and bowed to me, saying,

"Owl God, Great God, thank you for coming to our humble home. We were once wealthy enough to count ourselves among the rich, but now we are just insignificant poor people. It is presumptuous to have the country's god, the Great God, stay with us, but since it is already dark, we will have the Great God stay with us tonight, and tomorrow we will send you off with just inau."

He repeated his bows many times. The old woman laid a mat under the east window and placed me there. Then, everyone went to sleep and immediately began to snore loudly.

I sat between my ears, but soon, right around midnight, I woke up.

Singing "Silver droplets fall, fall all around, golden droplets fall, fall all around" quietly, I flew from the left side of the house to the right side, making beautiful sounds.

As I flapped my wings, beautiful treasures, divine treasures, fell and scattered around me, making beautiful sounds.

In an instant, I filled this small house with magnificent treasures, divine treasures.

Singing "Silver droplets fall, fall all around, golden droplets fall, fall all around," I transformed this small house into a house of gold, a large house, in an instant. I created a storehouse of magnificent treasures inside the house, and I quickly made beautiful, magnificent clothes and decorated the house.

I decorated the inside of this large house even more magnificently than a wealthy person's house. When I finished, I sat between my ears in my helmet as before.

I showed the people in a dream that I had seen the Ainu Nishpa, who was unlucky and had become poor, being ridiculed and bullied by those who were once poor but now rich, and I felt sorry for him. So, I, who am not just a humble god, stayed in a human house and bestowed blessings upon them.

After that was done, a little later, when it dawned, the people of the house woke up together and rubbed their eyes, looking around the house, and they all collapsed onto the floor. The old woman cried out, and the old man shed large tears, but soon the old man got up and came to me, bowing twenty or thirty times, and then said,

"We thought it was just a dream, just sleep, but it really happened. We are grateful that you came to our insignificant, humble home, but the country's god, the Great God, has pitied our misfortune and given us the greatest of blessings."

He said this while crying.

Then, the old man cut down an inau tree and made a magnificent inau beautifully and decorated me. The old woman dressed herself and had the small child help her, gathering firewood and drawing water, preparing to make sake, and in an instant, she lined up six sake barrels in the upper seat.

Then, I talked with the old woman of fire, the old goddess, and various gods.

After about two days, because it was the gods' favorite, the scent of sake filled the house.

So, they deliberately dressed the small child in old clothes and sent him out to invite the people in the village who were once poor but now rich.

As they watched him go, the child entered each house and delivered his message. The people who were once poor but now rich laughed loudly, saying,

"This is strange. What kind of sake and what kind of feast could those poor people be making that they are inviting people for? Let's go see what's going on and laugh at them."

Saying this, they came in a large group, and from far away, just seeing the house, some were surprised and embarrassed and went home, and some came to the front of the house and collapsed.

Then, the woman of the house came outside and took everyone's hand and led them into the house, and everyone crawled in, not even raising their faces.

Then, the master of the house got up and spoke in a beautiful voice like a cuckoo bird. He told the story of what had happened, saying,

"Like this, we were poor and could not even visit each other, but the Great God pitied us, and because we had no bad intentions, we received these blessings. From now on, everyone in the village, we are all family, so I hope that we can be friendly and visit each other."

When he said this, the people rubbed their hands together many times and apologized to the master of the house, and they talked about being friendly from now on.

Everyone bowed to me as well.

When that was done, everyone's hearts softened, and they held a lively sake feast.

I talked with the god of fire, the god of the house, and the gods of the gohei shelves, watching the humans dance and leap, and I was deeply amused. And after two or three days, the sake feast ended.

Seeing the humans being friendly with each other, I felt relieved and said goodbye to the god of fire, the god of the house, and the gods of the gohei shelves.

When that was done, I returned to my own home.

Before I arrived, my house was filled with beautiful gohei and fine sake.

So, I sent messengers to the near gods and the far gods and held a lively sake feast. At the feast, I told the gods in detail about the situation in the human village when I visited it and what happened there, and the gods praised me greatly.

When the gods left, I gave them two or three beautiful gohei each.

Looking towards that Ainu village, it is now peaceful, and the humans are all friendly, and that Nishpa is the head of the village.

His child is now an adult, with a wife and children, and is filial to his parents.

Whenever they make sake, they always send me gohei and sake at the beginning of the sake feast.

I also sit behind the humans and always protect the human country.

So, the owl god told the story.
