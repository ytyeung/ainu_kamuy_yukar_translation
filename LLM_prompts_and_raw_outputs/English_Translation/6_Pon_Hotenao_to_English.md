小狼の神が自ら歌った謡
「ホテナオ」

ホテナオ
ある日に退屈なので浜辺へ出て,
遊んでいたら一人の小男が
来ていたから,川下へ下ると
私も川下へ下り,
川上へ来ると私も川上へ行き道をさえぎった.
すると川下へ六回
川上へ六回になった時小男は
持前の癇癪かんしゃくを顔に表して言うことには,
「ピイピイ
この小僧め悪い小僧め,そんな事をするなら
この岬の,昔の名と今の名を
言い解いて見ろ」
私は聞いて笑いながらいうこと
には,
「誰がこの岬の昔の名と
今の名を知らないものか!
昔は,尊いえらい神様や人間が居ったから
この岬を神の岬と
言ったものだが,今は時代が衰えたから
御幣の岬とよんでいるのさ!」
云うと,小男の云うことには,
「ピイトン,ピイトン
この小僧め本当にお前はそういうなら
この川の前の名と今の名を
云って見ろ.」
聞くと,私の云うことには,
「誰がこの川の前の名
今の名を知らないものか!
昔,えらかった時代にはこの川を
流れの早い川と云っていたのだが
今は世が衰えているので流れの遅い川と
云っているのさ.」
云うと小男の云うことには,
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン
本当にお前そんな事を云うなら
お互の素性の解き合いをやろう.」
聞いて私の云うことには,
「誰がお前の素性を知らないものか!
大昔,オキキリムイが山へ行って
狩猟小舎を建てた時榛はしばみの木の炉縁ろぶちを作ったら
その炉縁が火に当ってからからに乾いてしまった.
オキキリムイが片方を踏むと片一方が
上る,それをオキキリムイが怒って
その炉縁を川へ持って下り
捨ててしまったのだ.
それからその炉縁は流れに沿うて流れていって
海へ出で,彼方かなたの海波,此方こなたの海波
に打ちつけられる様を神様たちが御覧になって,
敬うべきえらいオキキリムイの手作りの物がその様に
何の役にもたたず迷い流れて海水と共に腐ってしまうのは
勿体もったいない事だから神様たちから
その炉縁は魚にされて,
炉縁魚と
名づけられたのだ.
ところがその炉縁魚は,自分の素性が
わからないので,人にばけてうろついている.
その炉縁魚がお前なのさ.」
云うと,小男は顔色を
変え変え聞いていたが
「ピイトントン,ピイトントン!
お前は,小さい,狼の子なの
さ.」
云い終ると直ぐに海へパチャンと飛び込んだ.
あと見送ると一つの赤い魚が
尾鰭おびれを動かしてずーっと沖へ
行ってしまった.
と,幼い狼の神様が物語りました.

Here's a translation of the Japanese poem into English, aiming for a poetic feel while preserving the original meaning:

**The Little Wolf God's Own Song: "Hotenao"**

Hotenao,

One day, bored, I went down to the shore,
Playing there, when a little man appeared.
When I went downstream,
He followed me downstream,
When I went upstream, he blocked my way.
Six times downstream,
Six times upstream, until the little man,
His inherent temper rising to his face, declared:

"Peep-peep!
You little brat, you wicked brat! If you insist on this,
Tell me the old name and the new name
Of this cape!"
I listened and, laughing, replied:

"Who doesn't know the old name and the new name
Of this cape?
Long ago, because noble gods and humans lived here,
This cape was called Cape of the Gods,
But now, as the times have declined,
It is called Cape of the Gohei!"
Hearing this, the little man said:

"Peeton, Peeton!
You little brat, if you truly know,
Tell me the old name and the new name
Of this river!"
Hearing this, I replied:

"Who doesn't know the old name
And the new name of this river?
In the glorious past, this river
Was called the River of Swift Currents,
But now, as the world declines, it is called the River of Slow Currents!"
Hearing this, the little man said:

"Peetonton, Peetonton!
If you truly know such things,
Let us test each other's origins!"
Hearing this, I replied:

"Who doesn't know your origins?
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
And built a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
When the hearth frame dried out from the heat of the fire,
And when Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side would rise,
Okikirmui, angered by this,
Took the hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
Then the hearth frame floated along the current,
Out to sea, where distant waves, and nearby waves,
Crashed upon it. The gods, seeing this,
Thought it a waste that the handiwork of the revered and great Okikirmui
Should drift aimlessly, uselessly, and rot with the seawater.
So the gods transformed
The hearth frame into a fish,
Named the Hearth-Frame Fish.
But the Hearth-Frame Fish, not knowing its own origins,
Disguises itself as a person and wanders about.
That Hearth-Frame Fish is you!"
Hearing this, the little man's face
Changed color again and again, but then he said:

"Peetonton, Peetonton!
You are a small,
Wolf cub!"
Having said this, he immediately splashed into the sea.
Looking after him, I saw a single red fish
Moving its tail fins, heading far out to sea.

And so, the young wolf god told his tale.

Here's an English translation of the Japanese text, aiming to preserve the original meaning and tone:

**The Song Sung by the Young Wolf God Himself**
"Hotenao"

Hotenao

One day, being bored, I went to the beach,
And as I was playing, a little man
Came along. When I went downstream,
He also went downstream,
And when I went upstream, he also went upstream, blocking my way.
This happened six times downstream,
And six times upstream. Finally, the little man,
His inherent temper showing on his face, said,
"Pii-pii!
You little brat, you bad little brat! If you're going to do that,
Try to tell me the old name and the current name
Of this cape!"
I listened and, laughing, said,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name
Of this cape?
Long ago, because noble and great gods and people lived here,
This cape was called God's Cape,
But now that the times have declined,
It's called Gohei Cape!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton, pii-ton!
You little brat, if you really know so much,
Tell me the old name and the current name
Of this river!"
Hearing this, I said,
"Who doesn't know the old name and the current name
Of this river?
Long ago, in those great times, this river
Was called the Swift-Flowing River,
But now that the world has declined, it's called the Slow-Flowing River!"
Hearing this, the little man said,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
If you really know so much,
Let's reveal each other's true identities!"
Hearing this, I said,
"Who doesn't know your true identity?
Long ago, when Okikirmui went to the mountains
And built a hunting lodge, he made a hearth frame of hazel wood.
When that hearth frame was exposed to the fire, it dried out completely.
When Okikirmui stepped on one side, the other side
Rose up. Okikirmui, angered by this,
Took the hearth frame down to the river
And threw it away.
Then that hearth frame floated along the current,
Out to sea, and the gods watched
As it was struck by the waves from afar and the waves from near.
They thought, 'It's a waste that something made by the revered and great Okikirmui
Is wandering aimlessly and rotting with the seawater, serving no purpose.'
So the gods
Turned that hearth frame into a fish,
And it was named Hearth-Frame Fish.
However, that Hearth-Frame Fish, not knowing its own identity,
Is disguising itself as a person and wandering about.
That Hearth-Frame Fish is you!"
Hearing this, the little man's face
Changed color repeatedly, but he said,
"Pii-ton-ton, pii-ton-ton!
You are a small wolf child!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he splashed into the sea.
Watching him go, I saw a single red fish
Moving its tail fin and going far out to sea.
So, the young wolf god told the story.
